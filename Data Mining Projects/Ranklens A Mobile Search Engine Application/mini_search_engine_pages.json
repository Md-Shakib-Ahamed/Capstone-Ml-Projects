The size of the nodes represents the perceived importance of the page, and arrows represent hyperlinks. A simple illustration of the Pagerank algorithm. The percentage shows the perceived importance, and the arrows represent hyperlinks. PageRank ( PR ) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results. It is named after both the term \"web page\" and co-founder Larry Page . PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google: PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites. [ 1 ] Currently, PageRank is not the only algorithm used by Google to order search results, but it is the first algorithm that was used by the company, and it is the best known. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] As of September 24, 2019, all patents associated with PageRank have expired. [ 4 ] Description [ edit ] PageRank is a link analysis algorithm and it assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents, such as the World Wide Web , with the purpose of \"measuring\" its relative importance within the set. The algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references. The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element E is referred to as the PageRank of E and denoted by P R ( E ) . {\\displaystyle PR(E).} A PageRank results from a mathematical algorithm based on the Webgraph , created by all World Wide Web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges, taking into consideration authority hubs such as cnn.com or mayoclinic.org . The rank value indicates an importance of a particular page. A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support. The PageRank of a page is defined recursively and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it (\" incoming links \"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. [ 5 ] In practice, the PageRank concept may be vulnerable to manipulation. Research has been conducted into identifying falsely influenced PageRank rankings. The goal is to find an effective means of ignoring links from documents with falsely influenced PageRank. [ 6 ] Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com ), the IBM CLEVER project , the TrustRank algorithm, the Hummingbird algorithm, [ 7 ] and the SALSA algorithm . [ 8 ] History [ edit ] The eigenvalue problem behind PageRank's algorithm was independently rediscovered and reused in many scoring problems. In 1895, Edmund Landau suggested using it for determining the winner of a chess tournament. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The eigenvalue problem was also suggested in 1976 by Gabriel Pinski and Francis Narin, who worked on scientometrics ranking scientific journals, [ 11 ] in 1977 by Thomas Saaty in his concept of Analytic Hierarchy Process which weighted alternative choices, [ 12 ] and in 1995 by Bradley Love and Steven Sloman as a cognitive model for concepts, the centrality algorithm. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] A search engine called \" RankDex \" from IDD Information Services, designed by Robin Li in 1996, developed a strategy for site-scoring and page-ranking. [ 15 ] Li referred to his search mechanism as \"link analysis,\" which involved ranking the popularity of a web site based on how many other sites had linked to it. [ 16 ] RankDex, the first search engine with page-ranking and site-scoring algorithms, was launched in 1996. [ 17 ] Li filed a patent for the technology in RankDex in 1997; it was granted in 1999. [ 18 ] He later used it when he founded Baidu in China in 2000. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Google founder Larry Page referenced Li's work as a citation in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank. [ 21 ] [ 17 ] [ 22 ] Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed PageRank at Stanford University in 1996 as part of a research project about a new kind of search engine. An interview with Héctor García-Molina , Stanford Computer Science professor and advisor to Sergey, [ 23 ] provides background into the development of the page-rank algorithm. [ 24 ] Sergey Brin had the idea that information on the web could be ordered in a hierarchy by \"link popularity\": a page ranks higher as there are more links to it. [ 25 ] The system was developed with the help of Scott Hassan and Alan Steremberg, both of whom were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. [ 5 ] Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine , published in 1998. [ 5 ] Shortly after, Page and Brin founded Google Inc. , the company behind the Google search engine. While just one of many factors that determine the ranking of Google search results, PageRank continues to provide the basis for all of Google's web-search tools. [ 26 ] The name \"PageRank\" plays on the name of developer Larry Page, as well as of the concept of a web page . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The word is a trademark of Google, and the PageRank process has been patented ( U.S. patent 6,285,999 ). However, the patent is assigned to Stanford University and not to Google. Google has exclusive license rights on the patent from Stanford University. The university received 1.8 million shares of Google in exchange for use of the patent; it sold the shares in 2005 for $336 million. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] PageRank was influenced by citation analysis , early developed by Eugene Garfield in the 1950s at the University of Pennsylvania, and by Hyper Search , developed by Massimo Marchiori at the University of Padua . In the same year PageRank was introduced (1998), Jon Kleinberg published his work on HITS . Google's founders cite Garfield, Marchiori, and Kleinberg in their original papers. [ 5 ] [ 31 ] Algorithm [ edit ] The PageRank algorithm outputs a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page. PageRank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size. It is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided among all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process. The PageRank computations require several passes, called \"iterations\", through the collection to adjust approximate PageRank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value. A probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1. A 0.5 probability is commonly expressed as a \"50% chance\" of something happening. Hence, a document with a PageRank of 0.5 means there is a 50% chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to said document. PageRank works on the assumption that a page is important if many other important pages link to it. This means the more quality backlinks a page has, the higher its PageRank score. [1] Simplified algorithm [ edit ] Assume a small universe of four web pages: A , B , C , and D . Links from a page to itself are ignored. Multiple outbound links from one page to another page are treated as a single link. PageRank is initialized to the same value for all pages. In the original form of PageRank, the sum of PageRank over all pages was the total number of pages on the web at that time, so each page in this example would have an initial value of 1. However, later versions of PageRank, and the remainder of this section, assume a probability distribution between 0 and 1. Hence the initial value for each page in this example is 0.25. The PageRank transferred from a given page to the targets of its outbound links upon the next iteration is divided equally among all outbound links. If the only links in the system were from pages B , C , and D to A , each link would transfer 0.25 PageRank to A upon the next iteration, for a total of 0.75. P R ( A ) = P R ( B ) + P R ( C ) + P R ( D ) . {\\displaystyle PR(A)=PR(B)+PR(C)+PR(D).\\,} Suppose instead that page B had a link to pages C and A , page C had a link to page A , and page D had links to all three pages. Thus, upon the first iteration, page B would transfer half of its existing value (0.125) to page A and the other half (0.125) to page C . Page C would transfer all of its existing value (0.25) to the only page it links to, A . Since D had three outbound links, it would transfer one third of its existing value, or approximately 0.083, to A . At the completion of this iteration, page A will have a PageRank of approximately 0.458. P R ( A ) = P R ( B ) 2 + P R ( C ) 1 + P R ( D ) 3 . {\\displaystyle PR(A)={\\frac {PR(B)}{2}}+{\\frac {PR(C)}{1}}+{\\frac {PR(D)}{3}}.\\,} In other words, the PageRank conferred by an outbound link is equal to the document's own PageRank score divided by the number of outbound links L( ) . P R ( A ) = P R ( B ) L ( B ) + P R ( C ) L ( C ) + P R ( D ) L ( D ) . {\\displaystyle PR(A)={\\frac {PR(B)}{L(B)}}+{\\frac {PR(C)}{L(C)}}+{\\frac {PR(D)}{L(D)}}.\\,} In the general case, the PageRank value for any page u can be expressed as: P R ( u ) = ∑ v ∈ B u P R ( v ) L ( v ) {\\displaystyle PR(u)=\\sum _{v\\in B_{u}}{\\frac {PR(v)}{L(v)}}} , i.e. the PageRank value for a page u is dependent on the PageRank values for each page v contained in the set B u (the set containing all pages linking to page u ), divided by the number L ( v ) of links from page v . Damping factor [ edit ] The PageRank theory holds that an imaginary surfer who is randomly clicking on links will eventually stop clicking. The probability, at any step, that the person will continue following links is a damping factor d . The probability that they instead jump to any random page is 1 - d . Various studies have tested different damping factors, but it is generally assumed that the damping factor will be set around 0.85. [ 5 ] The damping factor is subtracted from 1 (and in some variations of the algorithm, the result is divided by the number of documents ( N ) in the collection) and this term is then added to the product of the damping factor and the sum of the incoming PageRank scores. That is, P R ( A ) = 1 − d N + d ( P R ( B ) L ( B ) + P R ( C ) L ( C ) + P R ( D ) L ( D ) + ⋯ ) . {\\displaystyle PR(A)={1-d \\over N}+d\\left({\\frac {PR(B)}{L(B)}}+{\\frac {PR(C)}{L(C)}}+{\\frac {PR(D)}{L(D)}}+\\,\\cdots \\right).} So any page's PageRank is derived in large part from the PageRanks of other pages. The damping factor adjusts the derived value downward. The original paper, however, gave the following formula, which has led to some confusion: P R ( A ) = 1 − d + d ( P R ( B ) L ( B ) + P R ( C ) L ( C ) + P R ( D ) L ( D ) + ⋯ ) . {\\displaystyle PR(A)=1-d+d\\left({\\frac {PR(B)}{L(B)}}+{\\frac {PR(C)}{L(C)}}+{\\frac {PR(D)}{L(D)}}+\\,\\cdots \\right).} The difference between them is that the PageRank values in the first formula sum to one, while in the second formula each PageRank is multiplied by N and the sum becomes N . A statement in Page and Brin's paper that \"the sum of all PageRanks is one\" [ 5 ] and claims by other Google employees [ 32 ] support the first variant of the formula above. Page and Brin confused the two formulas in their most popular paper \"The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine\", where they mistakenly claimed that the latter formula formed a probability distribution over web pages. [ 5 ] Google recalculates PageRank scores each time it crawls the Web and rebuilds its index. As Google increases the number of documents in its collection, the initial approximation of PageRank decreases for all documents. The formula uses a model of a random surfer who reaches their target site after several clicks, then switches to a random page. The PageRank value of a page reflects the chance that the random surfer will land on that page by clicking on a link. It can be understood as a Markov chain in which the states are pages, and the transitions are the links between pages – all of which are all equally probable. If a page has no links to other pages, it becomes a sink and therefore terminates the random surfing process. If the random surfer arrives at a sink page, it picks another URL at random and continues surfing again. When calculating PageRank, pages with no outbound links are assumed to link out to all other pages in the collection. Their PageRank scores are therefore divided evenly among all other pages. In other words, to be fair with pages that are not sinks, these random transitions are added to all nodes in the Web. This residual probability, d , is usually set to 0.85, estimated from the frequency that an average surfer uses his or her browser's bookmark feature. So, the equation is as follows: P R ( p i ) = 1 − d N + d ∑ p j ∈ M ( p i ) P R ( p j ) L ( p j ) {\\displaystyle PR(p_{i})={\\frac {1-d}{N}}+d\\sum _{p_{j}\\in M(p_{i})}{\\frac {PR(p_{j})}{L(p_{j})}}} where p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p N {\\displaystyle p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{N}} are the pages under consideration, M ( p i ) {\\displaystyle M(p_{i})} is the set of pages that link to p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} , L ( p j ) {\\displaystyle L(p_{j})} is the number of outbound links on page p j {\\displaystyle p_{j}} , and N {\\displaystyle N} is the total number of pages. The PageRank values are the entries of the dominant right eigenvector of the modified adjacency matrix rescaled so that each column adds up to one. This makes PageRank a particularly elegant metric: the eigenvector is R = [ P R ( p 1 ) P R ( p 2 ) ⋮ P R ( p N ) ] {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} ={\\begin{bmatrix}PR(p_{1})\\\\PR(p_{2})\\\\\\vdots \\\\PR(p_{N})\\end{bmatrix}}} where R is the solution of the equation R = [ ( 1 − d ) / N ( 1 − d ) / N ⋮ ( 1 − d ) / N ] + d [ ℓ ( p 1 , p 1 ) ℓ ( p 1 , p 2 ) ⋯ ℓ ( p 1 , p N ) ℓ ( p 2 , p 1 ) ⋱ ⋮ ⋮ ℓ ( p i , p j ) ℓ ( p N , p 1 ) ⋯ ℓ ( p N , p N ) ] R {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} ={\\begin{bmatrix}{(1-d)/N}\\\\{(1-d)/N}\\\\\\vdots \\\\{(1-d)/N}\\end{bmatrix}}+d{\\begin{bmatrix}\\ell (p_{1},p_{1})&\\ell (p_{1},p_{2})&\\cdots &\\ell (p_{1},p_{N})\\\\\\ell (p_{2},p_{1})&\\ddots &&\\vdots \\\\\\vdots &&\\ell (p_{i},p_{j})&\\\\\\ell (p_{N},p_{1})&\\cdots &&\\ell (p_{N},p_{N})\\end{bmatrix}}\\mathbf {R} } where the adjacency function ℓ ( p i , p j ) {\\displaystyle \\ell (p_{i},p_{j})} is the ratio between number of links outbound from page j to page i to the total number of outbound links of page j. The adjacency function is 0 if page p j {\\displaystyle p_{j}} does not link to p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} , and normalized such that, for each j ∑ i = 1 N ℓ ( p i , p j ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\ell (p_{i},p_{j})=1} , i.e. the elements of each column sum up to 1, so the matrix is a stochastic matrix (for more details see the computation section below). Thus this is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure used commonly in network analysis . Because of the large eigengap of the modified adjacency matrix above, [ 33 ] the values of the PageRank eigenvector can be approximated to within a high degree of accuracy within only a few iterations. Google's founders, in their original paper, [ 31 ] reported that the PageRank algorithm for a network consisting of 322 million links (in-edges and out-edges) converges to within a tolerable limit in 52 iterations. The convergence in a network of half the above size took approximately 45 iterations. Through this data, they concluded the algorithm can be scaled very well and that the scaling factor for extremely large networks would be roughly linear in log ⁡ n {\\displaystyle \\log n} , where n is the size of the network. As a result of Markov theory , it can be shown that the PageRank of a page is the probability of arriving at that page after a large number of clicks. This happens to equal t − 1 {\\displaystyle t^{-1}} where t {\\displaystyle t} is the expectation of the number of clicks (or random jumps) required to get from the page back to itself. One main disadvantage of PageRank is that it favors older pages. A new page, even a very good one, will not have many links unless it is part of an existing site (a site being a densely connected set of pages, such as Wikipedia ). Several strategies have been proposed to accelerate the computation of PageRank. [ 34 ] Various strategies to manipulate PageRank have been employed in concerted efforts to improve search results rankings and monetize advertising links. These strategies have severely impacted the reliability of the PageRank concept, [ citation needed ] which purports to determine which documents are actually highly valued by the Web community. Since December 2007, when it started actively penalizing sites selling paid text links, Google has combatted link farms and other schemes designed to artificially inflate PageRank. How Google identifies link farms and other PageRank manipulation tools is among Google's trade secrets . Computation [ edit ] PageRank can be computed either iteratively or algebraically. The iterative method can be viewed as the power iteration method [ 35 ] [ 36 ] or the power method. The basic mathematical operations performed are identical. Iterative [ edit ] At t = 0 {\\displaystyle t=0} , an initial probability distribution is assumed, usually P R ( p i ; 0 ) = 1 N {\\displaystyle PR(p_{i};0)={\\frac {1}{N}}} . where N is the total number of pages, and p i ; 0 {\\displaystyle p_{i};0} is page i at time 0. At each time step, the computation, as detailed above, yields P R ( p i ; t + 1 ) = 1 − d N + d ∑ p j ∈ M ( p i ) P R ( p j ; t ) L ( p j ) {\\displaystyle PR(p_{i};t+1)={\\frac {1-d}{N}}+d\\sum _{p_{j}\\in M(p_{i})}{\\frac {PR(p_{j};t)}{L(p_{j})}}} where d is the damping factor, or in matrix notation R ( t + 1 ) = d M R ( t ) + 1 − d N 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} (t+1)=d{\\mathcal {M}}\\mathbf {R} (t)+{\\frac {1-d}{N}}\\mathbf {1} } , 1 where R i ( t ) = P R ( p i ; t ) {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} _{i}(t)=PR(p_{i};t)} and 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} } is the column vector of length N {\\displaystyle N} containing only ones. The matrix M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} is defined as M i j = { 1 / L ( p j ) , if j links to i 0 , otherwise {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}_{ij}={\\begin{cases}1/L(p_{j}),&{\\mbox{if }}j{\\mbox{ links to }}i\\ \\\\0,&{\\mbox{otherwise}}\\end{cases}}} i.e., M := ( K − 1 A ) T {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}:=(K^{-1}A)^{T}} , where A {\\displaystyle A} denotes the adjacency matrix of the graph and K {\\displaystyle K} is the diagonal matrix with the outdegrees in the diagonal. The probability calculation is made for each page at a time point, then repeated for the next time point. The computation ends when for some small ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } | R ( t + 1 ) − R ( t ) | < ϵ {\\displaystyle |\\mathbf {R} (t+1)-\\mathbf {R} (t)|<\\epsilon } , i.e., when convergence is assumed. Power method [ edit ] If the matrix M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} is a transition probability, i.e., column-stochastic and R {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} } is a probability distribution (i.e., | R | = 1 {\\displaystyle |\\mathbf {R} |=1} , E R = 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {E} \\mathbf {R} =\\mathbf {1} } where E {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {E} } is matrix of all ones), then equation ( 2 ) is equivalent to R = ( d M + 1 − d N E ) R =: M ^ R {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} =\\left(d{\\mathcal {M}}+{\\frac {1-d}{N}}\\mathbf {E} \\right)\\mathbf {R} =:{\\widehat {\\mathcal {M}}}\\mathbf {R} } . 3 Hence PageRank R {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} } is the principal eigenvector of M ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {\\mathcal {M}}}} . A fast and easy way to compute this is using the power method : starting with an arbitrary vector x ( 0 ) {\\displaystyle x(0)} , the operator M ^ {\\displaystyle {\\widehat {\\mathcal {M}}}} is applied in succession, i.e., x ( t + 1 ) = M ^ x ( t ) {\\displaystyle x(t+1)={\\widehat {\\mathcal {M}}}x(t)} , until | x ( t + 1 ) − x ( t ) | < ϵ {\\displaystyle |x(t+1)-x(t)|<\\epsilon } . Note that in equation ( 3 ) the matrix on the right-hand side in the parenthesis can be interpreted as 1 − d N E = ( 1 − d ) P 1 t {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1-d}{N}}\\mathbf {E} =(1-d)\\mathbf {P} \\mathbf {1} ^{t}} , where P {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {P} } is an initial probability distribution. n the current case P := 1 N 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {P} :={\\frac {1}{N}}\\mathbf {1} } . Finally, if M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} has columns with only zero values, they should be replaced with the initial probability vector P {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {P} } . In other words, M ′ := M + D {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}^{\\prime }:={\\mathcal {M}}+{\\mathcal {D}}} , where the matrix D {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}} is defined as D := P D t {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}:=\\mathbf {P} \\mathbf {D} ^{t}} , with D i = { 1 , if L ( p i ) = 0 0 , otherwise {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {D} _{i}={\\begin{cases}1,&{\\mbox{if }}L(p_{i})=0\\ \\\\0,&{\\mbox{otherwise}}\\end{cases}}} In this case, the above two computations using M {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {M}}} only give the same PageRank if their results are normalized: R power = R iterative | R iterative | = R algebraic | R algebraic | {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} _{\\textrm {power}}={\\frac {\\mathbf {R} _{\\textrm {iterative}}}{|\\mathbf {R} _{\\textrm {iterative}}|}}={\\frac {\\mathbf {R} _{\\textrm {algebraic}}}{|\\mathbf {R} _{\\textrm {algebraic}}|}}} . Implementation [ edit ] Python [ edit ] import numpy as np def pagerank ( M , d : float = 0.85 ): \"\"\"PageRank algorithm with explicit number of iterations.

Parameters ---------- M : numpy array adjacency matrix where M_i,j represents the link from 'j' to 'i', such that for all 'j' sum(i, M_i,j) = 1 d : float, optional damping factor, by default 0.85 Returns ------- numpy array a vector of ranks such that v_i is the i-th rank from [0, 1], \"\"\" N = M . shape [ 1 ] w = np . ones ( N ) / N M_hat = d * M v = M_hat @ w + ( 1 - d ) / N while np . linalg . norm ( w - v ) >= 1e-10 : w = v v = M_hat @ w + ( 1 - d ) / N return v M = np . array ([[ 0 , 0 , 0 , .25 ], [ 0 , 0 , 0 , .5 ], [ 1 , 0.5 , 0 , .25 ], [ 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 0 ]]) v = pagerank ( M , 0.85 ) Variations [ edit ] PageRank of an undirected graph [ edit ] The PageRank of an undirected graph G {\\displaystyle G} is statistically close to the degree distribution of the graph G {\\displaystyle G} , [ 37 ] but they are generally not identical: If R {\\displaystyle R} is the PageRank vector defined above, and D {\\displaystyle D} is the degree distribution vector D = 1 2 | E | [ deg ⁡ ( p 1 ) deg ⁡ ( p 2 ) ⋮ deg ⁡ ( p N ) ] {\\displaystyle D={1 \\over 2|E|}{\\begin{bmatrix}\\deg(p_{1})\\\\\\deg(p_{2})\\\\\\vdots \\\\\\deg(p_{N})\\end{bmatrix}}} where deg ⁡ ( p i ) {\\displaystyle \\deg(p_{i})} denotes the degree of vertex p i {\\displaystyle p_{i}} , and E {\\displaystyle E} is the edge-set of the graph, then, with Y = 1 N 1 {\\displaystyle Y={1 \\over N}\\mathbf {1} } , [ 38 ] shows that: 1 − d 1 + d ‖ Y − D ‖ 1 ≤ ‖ R − D ‖ 1 ≤ ‖ Y − D ‖ 1 , {\\displaystyle {1-d \\over 1+d}\\|Y-D\\|_{1}\\leq \\|R-D\\|_{1}\\leq \\|Y-D\\|_{1},} that is, the PageRank of an undirected graph equals to the degree distribution vector if and only if the graph is regular, i.e., every vertex has the same degree. Ranking objects of two kinds [ edit ] A generalization of PageRank for the case of ranking two interacting groups of objects was described by Daugulis. [ 39 ] In applications it may be necessary to model systems having objects of two kinds where a weighted relation is defined on object pairs. This leads to considering bipartite graphs . For such graphs two related positive or nonnegative irreducible matrices corresponding to vertex partition sets can be defined. One can compute rankings of objects in both groups as eigenvectors corresponding to the maximal positive eigenvalues of these matrices. Normed eigenvectors exist and are unique by the Perron or Perron–Frobenius theorem. Example: consumers and products. The relation weight is the product consumption rate. Distributed algorithm for PageRank computation [ edit ] Sarma et al. describe two random walk -based distributed algorithms for computing PageRank of nodes in a network. [ 40 ] One algorithm takes O ( log ⁡ n / ϵ ) {\\displaystyle O(\\log n/\\epsilon )} rounds with high probability on any graph (directed or undirected), where n is the network size and ϵ {\\displaystyle \\epsilon } is the reset probability ( 1 − ϵ {\\displaystyle 1-\\epsilon } , which is called the damping factor) used in the PageRank computation. They also present a faster algorithm that takes O ( log ⁡ n / ϵ ) {\\displaystyle O({\\sqrt {\\log n}}/\\epsilon )} rounds in undirected graphs. In both algorithms, each node processes and sends a number of bits per round that are polylogarithmic in n, the network size. Google Toolbar [ edit ] The Google Toolbar long had a PageRank feature which displayed a visited page's PageRank as a whole number between 0 (least popular) and 10 (most popular). Google had not disclosed the specific method for determining a Toolbar PageRank value, which was to be considered only a rough indication of the value of a website. The \"Toolbar Pagerank\" was available for verified site maintainers through the Google Webmaster Tools interface. However, on October 15, 2009, a Google employee confirmed that the company had removed PageRank from its Webmaster Tools section, saying that \"We've been telling people for a long time that they shouldn't focus on PageRank so much. Many site owners seem to think it's the most important metric for them to track, which is simply not true.\" [ 41 ] The \"Toolbar Pagerank\" was updated very infrequently. It was last updated in November 2013. In October 2014 Matt Cutts announced that another visible pagerank update would not be coming. [ 42 ] In March 2016 Google announced it would no longer support this feature, and the underlying API would soon cease to operate. [ 43 ] On April 15, 2016, Google turned off display of PageRank Data in Google Toolbar, [ 44 ] though the PageRank continued to be used internally to rank content in search results. [ 45 ] SERP rank [ edit ] The search engine results page (SERP) is the actual result returned by a search engine in response to a keyword query. The SERP consists of a list of links to web pages with associated text snippets, paid ads, featured snippets, and Q&A. The SERP rank of a web page refers to the placement of the corresponding link on the SERP, where higher placement means higher SERP rank. The SERP rank of a web page is a function not only of its PageRank, but of a relatively large and continuously adjusted set of factors (over 200). [ 46 ] [ unreliable source? ] Search engine optimization (SEO) is aimed at influencing the SERP rank for a website or a set of web pages. Positioning of a webpage on Google SERPs for a keyword depends on relevance and reputation, also known as authority and popularity. PageRank is Google's indication of its assessment of the reputation of a webpage: It is non-keyword specific. Google uses a combination of webpage and website authority to determine the overall authority of a webpage competing for a keyword. [ 47 ] The PageRank of the HomePage of a website is the best indication Google offers for website authority. [ 48 ] After the introduction of Google Places into the mainstream organic SERP, numerous other factors in addition to PageRank affect ranking a business in Local Business Results. [ 49 ] When Google elaborated on the reasons for PageRank deprecation at Q&A #March 2016, they announced Links and Content as the Top Ranking Factors. RankBrain had earlier in October 2015 been announced as the #3 Ranking Factor, so the Top 3 Factors have been confirmed officially by Google. [ 50 ] Google directory PageRank [ edit ] The Google Directory PageRank was an 8-unit measurement. Unlike the Google Toolbar, which showed a numeric PageRank value upon mouseover of the green bar, the Google Directory only displayed the bar, never the numeric values. Google Directory was closed on July 20, 2011. [ 51 ] False or spoofed PageRank [ edit ] It was known that the PageRank shown in the Toolbar could easily be spoofed . Redirection from one page to another, either via a HTTP 302 response or a \"Refresh\" meta tag , caused the source page to acquire the PageRank of the destination page. Hence, a new page with PR 0 and no incoming links could have acquired PR 10 by redirecting to the Google home page. Spoofing can usually be detected by performing a Google search for a source URL; if the URL of an entirely different site is displayed in the results, the latter URL may represent the destination of a redirection. Manipulating PageRank [ edit ] Part of a series on Internet marketing Search engine optimization Local search engine optimisation Social media marketing Email marketing Referral marketing Content marketing Native advertising Search engine marketing Pay-per-click Cost per impression Search analytics Web analytics Display advertising Ad blocking Contextual advertising Behavioral targeting Mobile advertising Affiliate marketing Cost per action Revenue sharing Misc Keyword density Keyword research PageRank WordPress CMS v t e For search engine optimization purposes, some companies offer to sell high PageRank links to webmasters. [ 52 ] As links from higher-PR pages are believed to be more valuable, they tend to be more expensive. It can be an effective and viable marketing strategy to buy link advertisements on content pages of quality and relevant sites to drive traffic and increase a webmaster's link popularity. However, Google has publicly warned webmasters that if they are or were discovered to be selling links for the purpose of conferring PageRank and reputation, their links will be devalued (ignored in the calculation of other pages' PageRanks). The practice of buying and selling [ 53 ] is intensely debated across the Webmaster community. Google advised webmasters to use the nofollow HTML attribute value on paid links. According to Matt Cutts , Google is concerned about webmasters who try to game the system , and thereby reduce the quality and relevance of Google search results. [ 52 ] In 2019, Google announced two additional link attributes providing hints about which links to consider or exclude within Search: rel=\"ugc\" as a tag for user-generated content, such as comments; and rel=\"sponsored\" as a tag for advertisements or other types of sponsored content. Multiple rel values are also allowed, for example, rel=\"ugc sponsored\" can be used to hint that the link came from user-generated content and is sponsored. [ 54 ] Even though PageRank has become less important for SEO purposes, the existence of back-links from more popular websites continues to push a webpage higher up in search rankings. [ 55 ] Directed Surfer Model [ edit ] A more intelligent surfer that probabilistically hops from page to page depending on the content of the pages and query terms the surfer is looking for. This model is based on a query-dependent PageRank score of a page which as the name suggests is also a function of query. When given a multiple-term query, Q = { q 1 , q 2 , ⋯ } {\\displaystyle Q=\\{q1,q2,\\cdots \\}} , the surfer selects a q {\\displaystyle q} according to some probability distribution, P ( q ) {\\displaystyle P(q)} , and uses that term to guide its behavior for a large number of steps. It then selects another term according to the distribution to determine its behavior, and so on. The resulting distribution over visited web pages is QD-PageRank. [ 56 ] Other uses [ edit ] The mathematics of PageRank are entirely general and apply to any graph or network in any domain. Thus, PageRank is now regularly used in bibliometrics, social and information network analysis, and for link prediction and recommendation. It is used for systems analysis of road networks, and in biology, chemistry, neuroscience, and physics. [ 57 ] Scientific research and academia [ edit ] PageRank has been used to quantify the scientific impact of researchers. The underlying citation and collaboration networks are used in conjunction with PageRank algorithm in order to come up with a ranking system for individual publications which propagates to individual authors. The new index known as pagerank-index (Pi) is demonstrated to be fairer compared to h-index in the context of many drawbacks exhibited by h-index. [ 58 ] For the analysis of protein networks in biology PageRank is also a useful tool. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] In any ecosystem, a modified version of PageRank may be used to determine species that are essential to the continuing health of the environment. [ 61 ] A similar newer use of PageRank is to rank academic doctoral programs based on their records of placing their graduates in faculty positions. In PageRank terms, academic departments link to each other by hiring their faculty from each other (and from themselves). [ 62 ] A version of PageRank has recently been proposed as a replacement for the traditional Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) impact factor , [ 63 ] and implemented at Eigenfactor as well as at SCImago . Instead of merely counting total citations to a journal, the \"importance\" of each citation is determined in a PageRank fashion. In neuroscience , the PageRank of a neuron in a neural network has been found to correlate with its relative firing rate. [ 64 ] Internet use [ edit ] Personalized PageRank is used by Twitter to present users with other accounts they may wish to follow. [ 65 ] Swiftype 's site search product builds a \"PageRank that's specific to individual websites\" by looking at each website's signals of importance and prioritizing content based on factors such as number of links from the home page. [ 66 ] A Web crawler may use PageRank as one of a number of importance metrics it uses to determine which URL to visit during a crawl of the web. One of the early working papers [ 67 ] that were used in the creation of Google is Efficient crawling through URL ordering , [ 68 ] which discusses the use of a number of different importance metrics to determine how deeply, and how much of a site Google will crawl. PageRank is presented as one of a number of these importance metrics, though there are others listed such as the number of inbound and outbound links for a URL, and the distance from the root directory on a site to the URL. The PageRank may also be used as a methodology to measure the apparent impact of a community like the Blogosphere on the overall Web itself. This approach uses therefore the PageRank to measure the distribution of attention in reflection of the Scale-free network paradigm. [ citation needed ] Other applications [ edit ] In 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan, Structural Deep Democracy, SD2 [ 69 ] [ 70 ] was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses PageRank for the processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be used. In sport the PageRank algorithm has been used to rank the performance of: teams in the National Football League (NFL) in the USA; [ 71 ] individual soccer players; [ 72 ] and athletes in the Diamond League. [ 73 ] PageRank has been used to rank spaces or streets to predict how many people (pedestrians or vehicles) come to the individual spaces or streets. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] In lexical semantics it has been used to perform Word Sense Disambiguation , [ 76 ] Semantic similarity , [ 77 ] and also to automatically rank WordNet synsets according to how strongly they possess a given semantic property, such as positivity or negativity. [ 78 ] How a traffic system changes its operational mode can be described by transitions between quasi-stationary states in correlation structures of traffic flow. PageRank has been used to identify and explore the dominant states among these quasi-stationary states in traffic systems. [ 79 ] nofollow [ edit ] In early 2005, Google implemented a new value, \" nofollow \", [ 80 ] for the rel attribute of HTML link and anchor elements, so that website developers and bloggers can make links that Google will not consider for the purposes of PageRank—they are links that no longer constitute a \"vote\" in the PageRank system. The nofollow relationship was added in an attempt to help combat spamdexing . As an example, people could previously create many message-board posts with links to their website to artificially inflate their PageRank. With the nofollow value, message-board administrators can modify their code to automatically insert \"rel='nofollow'\" to all hyperlinks in posts, thus preventing PageRank from being affected by those particular posts. This method of avoidance, however, also has various drawbacks, such as reducing the link value of legitimate comments. (See: Spam in blogs#nofollow ) In an effort to manually control the flow of PageRank among pages within a website, many webmasters practice what is known as PageRank Sculpting [ 81 ] —which is the act of strategically placing the nofollow attribute on certain internal links of a website in order to funnel PageRank towards those pages the webmaster deemed most important. This tactic had been used since the inception of the nofollow attribute, but may no longer be effective since Google announced that blocking PageRank transfer with nofollow does not redirect that PageRank to other links.

The idea behind Hubs and Authorities stemmed from a particular insight into the creation of web pages when the Internet was originally forming; that is, certain web pages, known as hubs, served as large directories that were not actually authoritative in the information that they held, but were used as compilations of a broad catalog of information that led users direct to other authoritative pages. In other words, a good hub represents a page that pointed to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs. [ 1 ] The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages. History [ edit ] In journals [ edit ] Many methods have been used to rank the importance of scientific journals. One such method is Garfield's impact factor . Journals such as Science and Nature are filled with numerous citations, making these magazines have very high impact factors. Thus, when comparing two more obscure journals which have received roughly the same number of citations but one of these journals has received many citations from Science and Nature , this journal needs be ranked higher. In other words, it is better to receive citations from an important journal than from an unimportant one. [ 2 ] On the Web [ edit ] This phenomenon also occurs in the Internet . Counting the number of links to a page can give us a general estimate of its prominence on the Web, but a page with very few incoming links may also be prominent, if two of these links come from the home pages of sites like Yahoo! , Google , or MSN . Because these sites are of very high importance but are also search engines , a page can be ranked much higher than its actual relevance. Algorithm [ edit ] Expanding the root set into a base set Further information: SALSA algorithm Steps [ edit ] In the HITS algorithm, the first step is to retrieve the most relevant pages to the search query. This set is called the root set and can be obtained by taking the top pages returned by a text-based search algorithm. A base set is generated by augmenting the root set with all the web pages that are linked from it and some of the pages that link to it. The web pages in the base set and all hyperlinks among those pages form a focused subgraph. The HITS computation is performed only on this focused subgraph . According to Kleinberg the reason for constructing a base set is to ensure that most (or many) of the strongest authorities are included. Authority and hub values are defined in terms of one another in a mutual recursion . An authority value is computed as the sum of the scaled hub values that point to that page. A hub value is the sum of the scaled authority values of the pages it points to. Some implementations also consider the relevance of the linked pages. The algorithm performs a series of iterations, each consisting of two basic steps: Authority update : Update each node's authority score to be equal to the sum of the hub scores of each node that points to it. That is, a node is given a high authority score by being linked from pages that are recognized as Hubs for information. Hub update : Update each node's hub score to be equal to the sum of the authority scores of each node that it points to. That is, a node is given a high hub score by linking to nodes that are considered to be authorities on the subject. The Hub score and Authority score for a node is calculated with the following algorithm: Start with each node having a hub score and authority score of 1. Run the authority update rule Run the hub update rule Normalize the values by dividing each Hub score by square root of the sum of the squares of all Hub scores, and dividing each Authority score by square root of the sum of the squares of all Authority scores. Repeat from the second step as necessary. Comparison to PageRank [ edit ] HITS, like Page and Brin 's PageRank , is an iterative algorithm based on the linkage of the documents on the web . However it does have some major differences: It is processed on a small subset of ‘relevant’ documents (a 'focused subgraph' or base set), instead of the set of all documents as was the case with PageRank. It is query-dependent: the same page can receive a different hub/authority score given a different base set, which appears for a different query; It must, as a corollary, be executed at query time, not at indexing time, with the associated drop in performance that accompanies query-time processing. It computes two scores per document (hub and authority) as opposed to a single score; It is not commonly used by search engines (though a similar algorithm was said to be used by Teoma , which was acquired by Ask Jeeves/Ask.com ). In detail [ edit ] To begin the ranking, we let a u t h ( p ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {auth} (p)=1} and h u b ( p ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {hub} (p)=1} for each page p {\\displaystyle p} . We consider two types of updates: Authority Update Rule and Hub Update Rule. In order to calculate the hub/authority scores of each node, repeated iterations of the Authority Update Rule and the Hub Update Rule are applied. A k-step application of the Hub-Authority algorithm entails applying for k times first the Authority Update Rule and then the Hub Update Rule. Authority update rule [ edit ] For each p {\\displaystyle p} , we update a u t h ( p ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {auth} (p)} to a u t h ( p ) = ∑ q ∈ P t o h u b ( q ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {auth} (p)=\\displaystyle \\sum \\nolimits _{q\\in P_{\\mathrm {to} }}\\mathrm {hub} (q)} where P t o {\\displaystyle P_{\\mathrm {to} }} is all pages which link to page p {\\displaystyle p} . That is, a page's authority score is the sum of all the hub scores of pages that point to it. Hub update rule [ edit ] For each p {\\displaystyle p} , we update h u b ( p ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {hub} (p)} to h u b ( p ) = ∑ q ∈ P f r o m a u t h ( q ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {hub} (p)=\\displaystyle \\sum \\nolimits _{q\\in P_{\\mathrm {from} }}\\mathrm {auth} (q)} where P f r o m {\\displaystyle P_{\\mathrm {from} }} is all pages which page p {\\displaystyle p} links to. That is, a page's hub score is the sum of all the authority scores of pages it points to. Normalization [ edit ] The final hub-authority scores of nodes are determined after infinite repetitions of the algorithm. As directly and iteratively applying the Hub Update Rule and Authority Update Rule leads to diverging values, it is necessary to normalize the matrix after every iteration. Thus the values obtained from this process will eventually converge. Pseudocode [ edit ] G := set of pages for each page p in G do p .auth = 1 // p .auth is the authority score of the page p p .hub = 1 // p .hub is the hub score of the page p for step from 1 to k do // run the algorithm for k steps norm = 0 for each page p in G do // update all authority values first p .auth = 0 for each page q in p.incomingNeighbors do // p.incomingNeighbors is the set of pages that link to p p .auth += q .hub norm += square( p .auth) // calculate the sum of the squared auth values to normalise norm = sqrt(norm) for each page p in G do // update the auth scores p .auth = p .auth / norm // normalise the auth values norm = 0 for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p .hub = 0 for each page r in p.outgoingNeighbors do // p.outgoingNeighbors is the set of pages that p links to p .hub += r .auth norm += square( p .hub) // calculate the sum of the squared hub values to normalise norm = sqrt(norm) for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p .hub = p .hub / norm // normalise the hub values The hub and authority values converge in the pseudocode above. The code below does not converge, because it is necessary to limit the number of steps that the algorithm runs for. One way to get around this, however, would be to normalize the hub and authority values after each \"step\" by dividing each authority value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all authority values, and dividing each hub value by the square root of the sum of the squares of all hub values. This is what the pseudocode above does. Non-converging pseudocode [ edit ] G := set of pages for each page p in G do p .auth = 1 // p .auth is the authority score of the page p p .hub = 1 // p .hub is the hub score of the page p function HubsAndAuthorities( G ) for step from 1 to k do // run the algorithm for k steps for each page p in G do // update all authority values first p .auth = 0 for each page q in p.incomingNeighbors do // p.incomingNeighbors is the set of pages that link to p p .auth += q .hub for each page p in G do // then update all hub values p .hub = 0 for each page r in p.outgoingNeighbors do // p.outgoingNeighbors is the set of pages that p links to p .hub += r .auth See also [ edit ] PageRank References [ edit ] ^ Christopher D.

For other uses, see Search engine (disambiguation) . This article's tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia . See Wikipedia's guide to writing better articles for suggestions. ( June 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Some engines suggest queries when the user is typing in the search box . A search engine is a software system that provides hyperlinks to web pages , and other relevant information on the Web in response to a user's query . The user enters a query in a web browser or a mobile app , and the search results are typically presented as a list of hyperlinks accompanied by textual summaries and images. Users also have the option of limiting a search to specific types of results, such as images, videos, or news. For a search provider, its engine is part of a distributed computing system that can encompass many data centers throughout the world. The speed and accuracy of an engine's response to a query are based on a complex system of indexing that is continuously updated by automated web crawlers . This can include data mining the files and databases stored on web servers , although some content is not accessible to crawlers. There have been many search engines since the dawn of the Web in the 1990s, however, Google Search became the dominant one in the 2000s and has remained so. As of May 2025, according to StatCounter, Google holds approximately 89–90 % of the worldwide search share, with competitors trailing far behind: Bing (~4 %), Yandex (~2.5 %), Yahoo ! (~1.3 %), DuckDuckGo (~0.8 %), and Baidu (~0.7 %). [ 1 ] Notably, this marks the first time in over a decade that Google's share has fallen below the 90 % threshold. The business of websites improving their visibility in search results , known as marketing and optimization , has thus largely focused on Google.

[ 2 ] He described this system in an article titled \" As We May Think \" in The Atlantic Monthly . [ 3 ] The memex was intended to give a user the capability to overcome the ever-increasing difficulty of locating information in ever-growing centralized indices of scientific work. Vannevar Bush envisioned libraries of research with connected annotations, which are similar to modern hyperlinks . [ 4 ] Link analysis eventually became a crucial component of search engines through algorithms such as Hyper Search and PageRank . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] 1990s: Birth of search engines The first internet search engines predate the debut of the Web in December 1990: WHOIS user search dates back to 1982, [ 7 ] and the Knowbot Information Service multi-network user search was first implemented in 1989. [ 8 ] The first well documented search engine that searched content files, namely FTP files, was Archie , which debuted on 10 September 1990. [ 9 ] Prior to September 1993, the World Wide Web was entirely indexed by hand. There was a list of webservers edited by Tim Berners-Lee and hosted on the CERN webserver . One snapshot of the list in 1992 remains, [ 10 ] but as more and more web servers went online the central list could no longer keep up. On the NCSA site, new servers were announced under the title \"What's New!\". [ 11 ] The first tool used for searching content (as opposed to users) on the Internet was Archie . [ 12 ] The name stands for \"archive\" without the \"v\". [ 13 ] It was created by Alan Emtage , [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] computer science student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec , Canada. The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) sites, creating a searchable database of file names; however, Archie Search Engine did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manually. The rise of Gopher (created in 1991 by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota ) led to two new search programs, Veronica and Jughead . Like Archie, they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index systems. Veronica (Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to Computerized Archives) provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listings. Jughead (Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation And Display) was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher servers. While the name of the search engine \" Archie Search Engine \" was not a reference to the Archie comic book series, \" Veronica \" and \" Jughead \" are characters in the series, thus referencing their predecessor. In the summer of 1993, no search engine existed for the web, though numerous specialized catalogs were maintained by hand. Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of Geneva wrote a series of Perl scripts that periodically mirrored these pages and rewrote them into a standard format. This formed the basis for W3Catalog , the web's first primitive search engine, released on September 2, 1993. [ 17 ] In June 1993, Matthew Gray, then at MIT , produced what was probably the first web robot , the Perl -based World Wide Web Wanderer , and used it to generate an index called \"Wandex\". The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web, which it did until late 1995. The web's second search engine Aliweb appeared in November 1993. Aliweb did not use a web robot , but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular format. JumpStation (created in December 1993 [ 18 ] by Jonathon Fletcher ) used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index, and used a web form as the interface to its query program. It was thus the first WWW resource-discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine (crawling, indexing, and searching) as described below. Because of the limited resources available on the platform it ran on, its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountered. One of the first \"all text\" crawler-based search engines was WebCrawler , which came out in 1994. Unlike its predecessors, it allowed users to search for any word in any web page , which has become the standard for all major search engines since. It was also the search engine that was widely known by the public. Also, in 1994, Lycos (which started at Carnegie Mellon University ) was launched and became a major commercial endeavor. The first popular search engine on the Web was Yahoo! Search . [ 19 ] The first product from Yahoo! , founded by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994, was a Web directory called Yahoo! Directory . In 1995, a search function was added, allowing users to search Yahoo! Directory. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] It became one of the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest, but its search function operated on its web directory, rather than its full-text copies of web pages. Soon after, a number of search engines appeared and vied for popularity. These included Magellan , Excite , Infoseek , Inktomi , Northern Light , and AltaVista . Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based search. In 1996, Robin Li developed the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] and received a US patent for the technology. [ 25 ] It was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing, [ 26 ] predating the very similar algorithm patent filed by Google two years later in 1998. [ 27 ] Larry Page referenced Li's work in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank. [ 28 ] Li later used his RankDex technology for the Baidu search engine, which was founded by him in China and launched in 2000. In 1996, Netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal as the featured search engine on Netscape's web browser. There was so much interest that instead, Netscape struck deals with five of the major search engines: for $5 million a year, each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine page. The five engines were Yahoo!, Magellan, Lycos, Infoseek, and Excite. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Google adopted the idea of selling search terms in 1998 from a small search engine company named goto.com . This move had a significant effect on the search engine business, which went from struggling to one of the most profitable businesses in the Internet. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990s. [ 33 ] Several companies entered the market spectacularly, receiving record gains during their initial public offerings . Some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterprise-only editions, such as Northern Light. Many search engine companies were caught up in the dot-com bubble , a speculation-driven market boom that peaked in March 2000. 2000s–present: Post dot-com bubble Around 2000, Google's search engine rose to prominence. [ 34 ] The company achieved better results for many searches with an algorithm called PageRank , as was explained in the paper Anatomy of a Search Engine written by Sergey Brin and Larry Page , the later founders of Google. [ 6 ] This iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there, on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than others. Larry Page's patent for PageRank cites Robin Li 's earlier RankDex patent as an influence. [ 28 ] [ 24 ] Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engine. In contrast, many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal . In fact, the Google search engine became so popular that spoof engines emerged such as Mystery Seeker . By 2000, Yahoo! was providing search services based on Inktomi's search engine. Yahoo! acquired Inktomi in 2002, and Overture (which owned AlltheWeb and AltaVista) in 2003. Yahoo! switched to Google's search engine until 2004, when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisitions. Microsoft first launched MSN Search in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktomi. In early 1999, the site began to display listings from Looksmart , blended with results from Inktomi. For a short time in 1999, MSN Search used results from AltaVista instead. In 2004, Microsoft began a transition to its own search technology, powered by its own web crawler (called msnbot ). Microsoft's rebranded search engine, Bing , was launched on June 1, 2009. On July 29, 2009, Yahoo! and Microsoft finalized a deal in which Yahoo! Search would be powered by Microsoft Bing technology. As of 2019, [update] active search engine crawlers include those of Google, Sogou , Baidu, Bing, Gigablast , Mojeek , DuckDuckGo and Yandex . Approach Main article: Search engine technology A search engine maintains the following processes in near real time: [ 35 ] Web crawling Indexing Searching [ 36 ] Web search engines get their information by web crawling from site to site. The \"spider\" checks for the standard filename robots.txt , addressed to it. The robots.txt file contains directives for search spiders, telling it which pages to crawl and which pages not to crawl. After checking for robots.txt and either finding it or not, the spider sends certain information back to be indexed depending on many factors, such as the titles, page content, JavaScript , Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), headings, or its metadata in HTML meta tags . After a certain number of pages crawled, amount of data indexed, or time spent on the website, the spider stops crawling and moves on. \"[N]o web crawler may actually crawl the entire reachable web. Due to infinite websites, spider traps, spam, and other exigencies of the real web, crawlers instead apply a crawl policy to determine when the crawling of a site should be deemed sufficient. Some websites are crawled exhaustively, while others are crawled only partially\". [ 37 ] Indexing means associating words and other definable tokens found on web pages to their domain names and HTML -based fields. The associations are stored in a public database and accessible through web search queries. A query from a user can be a single word, multiple words or a sentence. The index helps find information relating to the query as quickly as possible. [ 36 ] Some of the techniques for indexing, and caching are trade secrets, whereas web crawling is a straightforward process of visiting all sites on a systematic basis. Between visits by the spider , the cached version of the page (some or all the content needed to render it) stored in the search engine working memory is quickly sent to an inquirer. If a visit is overdue, the search engine can just act as a web proxy instead. In this case, the page may differ from the search terms indexed. [ 36 ] The cached page holds the appearance of the version whose words were previously indexed, so a cached version of a page can be useful to the website when the actual page has been lost, but this problem is also considered a mild form of linkrot . High-level architecture of a standard Web crawler Typically, when a user enters a query into a search engine it is a few keywords . [ 38 ] The index already has the names of the sites containing the keywords, and these are instantly obtained from the index. The real processing load is in generating the web pages that are the search results list: Every page in the entire list must be weighted according to information in the indexes. [ 36 ] Then the top search result item requires the lookup, reconstruction, and markup of the snippets showing the context of the keywords matched. These are only part of the processing each search results web page requires, and further pages (next to the top) require more of this post-processing. Beyond simple keyword lookups, search engines offer their own GUI - or command-driven operators and search parameters to refine the search results. These provide the necessary controls for the user engaged in the feedback loop users create by filtering and weighting while refining the search results, given the initial pages of the first search results. For example, from 2007 the Google.com search engine has allowed one to filter by date by clicking \"Show search tools\" in the leftmost column of the initial search results page, and then selecting the desired date range. [ 39 ] It is also possible to weight by date because each page has a modification time. Most search engines support the use of the Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT to help end users refine the search query . Boolean operators are for literal searches that allow the user to refine and extend the terms of the search. The engine looks for the words or phrases exactly as entered. Some search engines provide an advanced feature called proximity search , which allows users to define the distance between keywords. [ 36 ] There is also concept-based searching where the research involves using statistical analysis on pages containing the words or phrases the user searches for. The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back. While there may be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase, some pages may be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. Most search engines employ methods to rank the results to provide the \"best\" results first. How a search engine decides which pages are the best matches, and what order the results should be shown in, varies widely from one engine to another. [ 36 ] The methods also change over time as Internet usage changes and new techniques evolve. There are two main types of search engine that have evolved: one is a system of predefined and hierarchically ordered keywords that humans have programmed extensively. The other is a system that generates an \" inverted index \" by analyzing texts it locates. This first form relies much more heavily on the computer itself to do the bulk of the work. Most Web search engines are commercial ventures supported by advertising revenue and thus some of them allow advertisers to have their listings ranked higher in search results for a fee. Search engines that do not accept money for their search results make money by running search related ads alongside the regular search engine results. The search engines make money every time someone clicks on one of these ads. [ 40 ] Local search Local search is the process that optimizes the efforts of local businesses. They focus on ensuring consistent search results. It is important because many people determine where they plan to go and what to buy based on their searches. [ 41 ] Market share As of January 2022, [update] Google is by far the world's most used search engine, with a market share of 90%, and the world's other most used search engines were Bing at 4%, Yandex at 2%, Yahoo! at 1%. Other search engines not listed have less than a 3% market share. [ 42 ] In 2024, Google's dominance was ruled an illegal monopoly in a case brought by the US Department of Justice. [ 43 ] Russia and East Asia This section needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( December 2023 ) As of late 2023 and early 2024, search engine market shares in Russia and East Asia have remained relatively stable but with some notable shifts due to geopolitical and technological developments. In Russia , Yandex continues to dominate the search engine market with a share of approximately 70.7% , while Google holds around 23.3% . [ 44 ] Yandex also remains a key player in localized services including navigation, ride-hailing, and e-commerce, strengthening its ecosystem. In China , Baidu remains the leading search engine with a market share of about 59.3% as of early 2024. Other domestic engines such as Sogou and 360 Search hold smaller shares. Google remains inaccessible in mainland China due to long-standing censorship issues, having exited the Chinese market in 2010 following disputes over censorship and cybersecurity. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Bing , Microsoft's search engine, has maintained a niche presence in China with a market share around 13.6% , making it one of the few foreign search engines operating under local regulatory constraints. [ 47 ] In South Korea , Naver continues to lead the domestic market, with a market share of 59.8% , followed by Google at 35.4% as of Q4 2023. [ 48 ] Naver’s strength lies in its localized services and integration with Korean content platforms. In Japan , Google Japan currently holds the largest market share (around 76.2% ), while Yahoo! Japan , operated by Z Holdings (a SoftBank and Naver joint venture), retains about 15.8% market share. [ 49 ] In Taiwan , Google is the predominant search engine, commanding over 93% of the market, with Yahoo! Taiwan and Bing trailing far behind. [ 50 ] Search engine bias Further information: Algorithmic bias Although search engines are programmed to rank websites based on some combination of their popularity and relevancy, empirical studies indicate various political, economic, and social biases in the information they provide [ 51 ] [ 52 ] and the underlying assumptions about the technology. [ 53 ] These biases can be a direct result of economic and commercial processes (e.g., companies that advertise with a search engine can become also more popular in its organic search results), and political processes (e.g., the removal of search results to comply with local laws). [ 54 ] For example, Google will not surface certain neo-Nazi websites in France and Germany, where Holocaust denial is illegal. Biases can also be a result of social processes, as search engine algorithms are frequently designed to exclude non-normative viewpoints in favor of more \"popular\" results. [ 55 ] Indexing algorithms of major search engines skew towards coverage of U.S.-based sites, rather than websites from non-U.S. countries. [ 52 ] Google Bombing is one example of an attempt to manipulate search results for political, social or commercial reasons. Several scholars have studied the cultural changes triggered by search engines, [ 56 ] and the representation of certain controversial topics in their results, such as terrorism in Ireland , [ 57 ] climate change denial , [ 58 ] and conspiracy theories . [ 59 ] Customized results and filter bubbles There has been concern raised that search engines such as Google and Bing provide customized results based on the user's activity history, leading to what has been termed echo chambers or filter bubbles by Eli Pariser in 2011. [ 60 ] The argument is that search engines and social media platforms use algorithms to selectively guess what information a user would like to see, based on information about the user (such as location, past click behavior and search history). As a result, websites tend to show only information that agrees with the user's past viewpoint. According to Eli Pariser users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. Since this problem has been identified, competing search engines have emerged that seek to avoid this problem by not tracking or \"bubbling\" users, such as DuckDuckGo . However many scholars have questioned Pariser's view, finding that there is little evidence for the filter bubble. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] [ 63 ] On the contrary, a number of studies trying to verify the existence of filter bubbles have found only minor levels of personalization in search, [ 63 ] that most people encounter a range of views when browsing online, and that Google news tends to promote mainstream established news outlets. [ 64 ] [ 62 ] Religious search engines The global growth of the Internet and electronic media in the Arab and Muslim world during the last decade has encouraged Islamic adherents in the Middle East and Asian sub-continent , to attempt their own search engines, their own filtered search portals that would enable users to perform safe searches . More than usual safe search filters, these Islamic web portals categorizing websites into being either \" halal \" or \" haram \", based on interpretation of Sharia law . ImHalal came online in September 2011. Halalgoogling came online in July 2013. These use haram filters on the collections from Google and Bing (and others). [ 65 ] While lack of investment and slow pace in technologies in the Muslim world has hindered progress and thwarted success of an Islamic search engine, targeting as the main consumers Islamic adherents, projects like Muxlim (a Muslim lifestyle site) received millions of dollars from investors like Rite Internet Ventures, and it also faltered. Other religion-oriented search engines are Jewogle, the Jewish version of Google, [ 66 ] and Christian search engine SeekFind.org. SeekFind filters sites that attack or degrade their faith. [ 67 ] Search engine submission Web search engine submission is a process in which a webmaster submits a website directly to a search engine. While search engine submission is sometimes presented as a way to promote a website, it generally is not necessary because the major search engines use web crawlers that will eventually find most web sites on the Internet without assistance. They can either submit one web page at a time, or they can submit the entire site using a sitemap , but it is normally only necessary to submit the home page of a web site as search engines are able to crawl a well designed website. There are two remaining reasons to submit a web site or web page to a search engine: to add an entirely new web site without waiting for a search engine to discover it, and to have a web site's record updated after a substantial redesign. Some search engine submission software not only submits websites to multiple search engines, but also adds links to websites from their own pages. This could appear helpful in increasing a website's ranking , because external links are one of the most important factors determining a website's ranking. However, John Mueller of Google has stated that this \"can lead to a tremendous number of unnatural links for your site\" with a negative impact on site ranking. [ 68 ] Comparison to social bookmarking See also: Social media optimization In comparison to search engines, a social bookmarking system has several advantages over traditional automated resource location and classification software, such as search engine spiders . All tag-based classification of Internet resources (such as web sites) is done by human beings, who understand the content of the resource, as opposed to software, which algorithmically attempts to determine the meaning and quality of a resource. Also, people can find and bookmark web pages that have not yet been noticed or indexed by web spiders. [ 69 ] Additionally, a social bookmarking system can rank a resource based on how many times it has been bookmarked by users, which may be a more useful metric for end-users than systems that rank resources based on the number of external links pointing to it. However, both types of ranking are vulnerable to fraud, (see Gaming the system ), and both need technical countermeasures to try to deal with this. Technology This article or section may need to be cleaned up or summarized. It has been split from/to Search engine technology#Web search engines . Archie The first web search engine was Archie , created in 1990 [ 70 ] by Alan Emtage , a student at McGill University in Montreal. The author originally wanted to call the program \"archives\", but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short, cryptic names such as grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and so on. [ citation needed ] The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This was (and still is) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet. It works like this: An administrator decides that they want to make files available from their computer. They set up a program on their computer, called an FTP server. When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer, they connect to it via another program called an FTP client. Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol. Initially, anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others. Later, \"anonymous\" FTP sites became repositories for files, allowing all users to post and retrieve them. Even with archive sites, many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers. These files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth: Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file. Archie changed all that. It combined a script-based data gatherer, which fetched site listings of anonymous FTP files, with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query. (4) In other words, Archie's gatherer scoured FTP sites across the Internet and indexed all of the files it found. Its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database. [ 71 ] Veronica In 1993, the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica . [ 70 ] It was created as a type of searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files. Another Gopher search service, called Jughead, appeared a little later, probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic-strip triumvirate. Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy's Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display, although, like Veronica, it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym. Jughead's functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica's, although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges. [ 71 ] The Lone Wanderer The World Wide Web Wanderer , developed by Matthew Gray in 1993 [ 72 ] was the first robot on the Web and was designed to track the Web's growth. Initially, the Wanderer counted only Web servers, but shortly after its introduction, it started to capture URLs as it went along. The database of captured URLs became the Wandex, the first web database. Matthew Gray's Wanderer created quite a controversy at the time, partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the Net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation. This degradation occurred because the Wanderer would access the same page hundreds of times a day. The Wanderer soon amended its ways, but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the Internet remained. In response to the Wanderer, Martijn Koster created Archie-Like Indexing of the Web, or ALIWEB, in October 1993. As the name implies, ALIWEB was the HTTP equivalent of Archie, and because of this, it is still unique in many ways. ALIWEB does not have a web-searching robot. Instead, webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed. The advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site, and a robot does not run about eating up Net bandwidth. The disadvantages of ALIWEB are more of a problem today. The primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted. Most users do not understand how to create such a file, and therefore they do not submit their pages. This leads to a relatively small database, which meant that users are less likely to search ALIWEB than one of the large bot-based sites. This Catch-22 has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the ALIWEB search, but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as Yahoo! or Lycos. [ 71 ] Excite Excite , initially called Architext, was started by six Stanford undergraduates in February 1993. Their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the Internet. Their project was fully funded by mid-1993. Once funding was secured. they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites. At the time, the software was called Architext, but it now goes by the name of Excite for Web Servers. [ 71 ] Excite was the first serious commercial search engine which launched in 1995. [ 73 ] It was developed in Stanford and was purchased for $6.5 billion by @Home. In 2001 Excite and @Home went bankrupt and InfoSpace bought Excite for $10 million. Some of the first analysis of web searching was conducted on search logs from Excite [ 74 ] [ 38 ] Yahoo! In April 1994, two Stanford University Ph.D. candidates, David Filo and Jerry Yang , created some pages that became rather popular. They called the collection of pages Yahoo! Their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos. As the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day, the team created ways to better organize the data. In order to aid in data retrieval, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) became a searchable directory. The search feature was a simple database search engine. Because Yahoo! entries were entered and categorized manually, Yahoo! was not really classified as a search engine. Instead, it was generally considered to be a searchable directory. Yahoo! has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process, blurring the distinction between engine and directory. The Wanderer captured only URLs, which made it difficult to find things that were not explicitly described by their URL. Because URLs are rather cryptic to begin with, this did not help the average user. Searching Yahoo! or the Galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites. Lycos At Carnegie Mellon University during July 1994, Michael Mauldin, on leave from CMU, developed the Lycos search engine. Types of web search engines Search engines on the web are sites enriched with facility to search the content stored on other sites. There is difference in the way various search engines work, but they all perform three basic tasks. [ 75 ] Finding and selecting full or partial content based on the keywords provided. Maintaining index of the content and referencing to the location they find Allowing users to look for words or combinations of words found in that index. The process begins when a user enters a query statement into the system through the interface provided. Type Example Description Conventional librarycatalog Search by keyword, title, author, etc. Text-based Google, Bing, Yahoo! Search by keywords. Limited search using queries in natural language. Voice-based Google, Bing, Yahoo! Search by keywords. Limited search using queries in natural language. Multimedia search QBIC, WebSeek, SaFe Search by visual appearance (shapes, colors,..) Q/A Stack Exchange , NSIR Search in (restricted) natural language Clustering Systems Vivisimo, Clusty, Togoda Research Systems Lemur, Nutch There are basically three types of search engines: Those that are powered by robots (called crawlers ; ants or spiders) and those that are powered by human submissions; and those that are a hybrid of the two. Crawler-based search engines are those that use automated software agents (called crawlers) that visit a Web site, read the information on the actual site, read the site's meta tags and also follow the links that the site connects to performing indexing on all linked Web sites as well. The crawler returns all that information back to a central depository, where the data is indexed. The crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed. The frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine. Human-powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued. Only information that is submitted is put into the index. In both cases, when a user queries a search engine to locate information, they're actually searching through the index that the search engine has created —they are not actually searching the Web. These indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched. This explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google, will return results that are, in fact, dead links. Since the search results are based on the index, if the index has not been updated since a Web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is. It will remain that way until the index is updated. So why will the same search on different search engines produce different results? Part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same. It depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted. But more important, not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices. The algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for. One of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page. Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant. But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing, or spamdexing. Another common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the Web. By analyzing how pages link to each other, an engine can both determine what a page is about (if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page) and whether that page is considered \"important\" and deserving of a boost in ranking. Just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing, it is also becoming more savvy to Web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking. Modern web search engines are highly intricate software systems that employ technology that has evolved over the years. There are a number of sub-categories of search engine software that are separately applicable to specific 'browsing' needs. These include web search engines (e.g. Google ), database or structured data search engines (e.g. Dieselpoint ), and mixed search engines or enterprise search. The more prevalent search engines, such as Google and Yahoo! , utilize hundreds of thousands computers to process trillions of web pages in order to return fairly well-aimed results. Due to this high volume of queries and text processing, the software is required to run in a highly dispersed environment with a high degree of superfluity. Another category of search engines is scientific search engines. These are search engines which search scientific literature. The best known example is Google Scholar. Researchers are working on improving search engine technology by making them understand the content element of the articles, such as extracting theoretical constructs or key research findings.

[ 1 ] Data mining is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and statistics with an overall goal of extracting information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transforming the information into a comprehensible structure for further use. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Data mining is the analysis step of the \" knowledge discovery in databases \" process, or KDD. [ 5 ] Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing , model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization , and online updating . [ 1 ] The term \"data mining\" is a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction ( mining ) of data itself . [ 6 ] It also is a buzzword [ 7 ] and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or information processing ( collection , extraction , warehousing , analysis, and statistics) as well as any application of computer decision support systems , including artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning) and business intelligence . Often the more general terms ( large scale ) data analysis and analytics —or, when referring to actual methods, artificial intelligence and machine learning —are more appropriate. The actual data mining task is the semi- automatic or automatic analysis of massive quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records ( cluster analysis ), unusual records ( anomaly detection ), and dependencies ( association rule mining , sequential pattern mining ). This usually involves using database techniques such as spatial indices . These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and predictive analytics . For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a decision support system . Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, although they do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps. The difference between data analysis and data mining is that data analysis is used to test models and hypotheses on the dataset, e.g., analyzing the effectiveness of a marketing campaign , regardless of the amount of data. In contrast, data mining uses machine learning and statistical models to uncover clandestine or hidden patterns in a large volume of data. [ 8 ] The related terms data dredging , data fishing , and data snooping refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations. Etymology [ edit ] In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like data fishing or data dredging to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term \"data mining\" was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1983. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Lovell indicates that the practice \"masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from \"experimentation\" (positive) to \"fishing\" or \"snooping\" (negative). The term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community, with generally positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, the phrase \"database mining\"™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego –based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation; [ 11 ] researchers consequently turned to data mining . Other terms used include data archaeology , information harvesting , information discovery , knowledge extraction , etc. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined the term \"knowledge discovery in databases\" for the first workshop on the same topic (KDD-1989) and this term became more popular in the AI and machine learning communities. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities. [ 12 ] Currently, the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably. Background [ edit ] The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes' theorem (1700s) and regression analysis (1800s). [ 13 ] The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As data sets have grown in size and complexity, direct \"hands-on\" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, specially in the field of machine learning, such as neural networks , cluster analysis , genetic algorithms (1950s), decision trees and decision rules (1960s), and support vector machines (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns. [ 14 ] in large data sets. It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever-larger data sets. Process [ edit ] The knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process is commonly defined with the stages: Selection Pre-processing Transformation Data mining Interpretation/evaluation. [ 5 ] It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases: Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation. Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA . However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models, [ 19 ] and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008. [ 20 ] Pre-processing [ edit ] Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse . Pre-processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data . Data mining [ edit ] Data mining involves six common classes of tasks: [ 5 ] Anomaly detection (outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation due to being out of standard range. Association rule learning (dependency modeling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis. Clustering – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another \"similar\", without using known structures in the data. Classification – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as \"legitimate\" or as \" spam \". Regression – attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is, for estimating the relationships among data or datasets. Summarization – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation. Results validation [ edit ] An example of data produced by data dredging through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen, apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders Data mining can unintentionally be misused, producing results that appear to be significant but which do not actually predict future behavior and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data, therefore bearing little use. This is sometimes caused by investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing . A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting , but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split—when applicable at all—may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening. [ 21 ] The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called overfitting . To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish \"spam\" from \"legitimate\" e-mails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had not been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as ROC curves . If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge. Research [ edit ] The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery 's (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ( SIGKDD ). [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings, [ 24 ] and since 1999 it has published a biannual academic journal titled \"SIGKDD Explorations\". [ 25 ] Computer science conferences on data mining include: CIKM Conference – ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Data mining topics are also present in many data management/database conferences such as the ICDE Conference, SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases . Standards [ edit ] There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example, the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006 but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft. For exchanging the extracted models—in particular for use in predictive analytics —the key standard is the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML), which is an XML -based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG. [ 26 ] Notable uses [ edit ] Main article: Examples of data mining See also: Category:Applied data mining Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available. Notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business, medicine, science, finance, construction, and surveillance. Privacy concerns and ethics [ edit ] While the term \"data mining\" itself may have no ethical implications, it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to user behavior (ethical and otherwise). [ 27 ] The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy , legality, and ethics . [ 28 ] In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE , has raised privacy concerns. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation . Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent). [ 31 ] This is not data mining per se , but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous. [ 32 ] Data may also be modified so as to become anonymous, so that individuals may not readily be identified. [ 31 ] However, even \" anonymized \" data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL . [ 33 ] The inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices. This indiscretion can cause financial, emotional, or bodily harm to the indicated individual. In one instance of privacy violation , the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data to pharmaceutical companies. [ 34 ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Europe has rather strong privacy laws, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers. However, the U.S.–E.U. Safe Harbor Principles , developed between 1998 and 2000, currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of Edward Snowden 's global surveillance disclosure , there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency , and attempts to reach an agreement with the United States have failed. [ 35 ] In the United Kingdom in particular there have been cases of corporations using data mining as a way to target certain groups of customers forcing them to pay unfairly high prices. These groups tend to be people of lower socio-economic status who are not savvy to the ways they can be exploited in digital market places. [ 36 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their \"informed consent\" regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in Biotech Business Week , \"'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,' says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals.\" [ 37 ] This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices. U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses. The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation. Copyright law [ edit ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Under European copyright database laws , the mining of in-copyright works (such as by web mining ) without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe, it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist, so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners' rights that are protected by the Database Directive . On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review , this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception . [ 38 ] The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive (2001), the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. Since 2020 also Switzerland has been regulating data mining by allowing it in the research field under certain conditions laid down by art. 24d of the Swiss Copyright Act. This new article entered into force on 1 April 2020. [ 39 ] The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe. [ 40 ] The focus on the solution to this legal issue, such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions, led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013. [ 41 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] US copyright law , and in particular its provision for fair use , upholds the legality of content mining in America, and other fair use countries such as Israel , Taiwan and South Korea . As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining.

Robin Li 李彦宏 Li in 2020 Born ( 1968-11-17 ) 17 November 1968 (age 56) Yangquan , Shanxi , China Education Peking University ( BMgt ) University at Buffalo ( MS ) Occupation(s) Software engineer , internet entrepreneur Title Co-founder and CEO of Baidu Chairman of iQIYI Board member of New Oriental Spouse Ma Dongmin (马东敏) Children 4 Chinese name Simplified Chinese 李彦宏 Traditional Chinese 李彥宏 Transcriptions Standard Mandarin Hanyu Pinyin Lǐ Yànhóng Gwoyeu Romatzyh Lii Yannhorng Wade–Giles Li Yenhung IPA [lì jɛ̂nxʊ̌ŋ] Robin Li Yanhong ( Chinese : 李彦宏 ; pinyin : Lǐ Yànhóng ; born 17 November 1968) is a Chinese software engineer and billionaire internet entrepreneur who is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Chinese multinational technology company Baidu . [ 1 ] As of May 2025, his net worth was estimated at US$5.5 billion by Forbes . [ 2 ] Li studied information management at Peking University and computer science at the University at Buffalo . In 1996, he created RankDex . [ 3 ] In 2000, he founded Baidu with Eric Xu . Li has been CEO of Baidu since January 2004. The company was listed on NASDAQ on August 5, 2005. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Li was a member of the 12th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 2013 to 2018. [ 6 ] During his tenure as CEO of Baidu, Li has been criticized for a number of controversies, including the death of Wei Zexi , advertising of unqualified hospitals on Tieba , and ad fraud. [ 7 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Li was born in Yangquan , Shanxi Province , where he spent most of his childhood. Both of his parents were factory workers. Li was the fourth of five children, and the only boy. [ 8 ] He earned a Bachelor of Management with a major in information management from Peking University . In fall 1991, Li went to the University at Buffalo in New York to study for a doctorate in computer science. He left the doctoral program with a master's degree in 1994. [ 8 ] RankDex [ edit ] In 1994, Li joined IDD Information Services, a New Jersey division of Dow Jones and Company , where he helped develop a software program for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal . [ 9 ] He also worked on improving algorithms for search engines. He remained at IDD Information Services from May 1994 to June 1997. In 1996, while at IDD, Li created the Rankdex site-scoring algorithm for search engine page ranking. [ 3 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Google cofounder Larry Page filed a patent for the PageRank search algorithm, two years later in 1998, which references Li's work on RankDex. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Li later used his Rankdex technology for the Baidu search engine. Baidu [ edit ] Li worked as a staff engineer for Infoseek , a pioneer internet search engine company, from July 1997 to December 1999. An achievement of his was the picture search function used by Go.com. [ 16 ] Since founding Baidu in January 2000, Li has turned the company into the largest Chinese search engine, with over 80% market share by search query, and the second largest independent [ vague ] search engine in the world. On 5 August 2005, Baidu completed its IPO on NASDAQ , and in 2007 was included in the NASDAQ -100 Index. [ 17 ] Recognition [ edit ] In 2001, he was named one of the \"Chinese Top Ten Innovative Pioneers\". [ 18 ] In 2002 and 2003, he was named one of the \"IT Ten Famous Persons\". [ 19 ] In April 2004, he was named in the second session of \"Chinese Software Ten Outstanding Young Persons\".

This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages. The account 34.68.0.0/16 has been blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s): Why you are seeing this message: Your current IP address is blocked from editing Wikipedia because it appears to belong to a VPN or proxy service . These types of services are commonly used for abusive editing and circumventing Wikipedia policies, so Wikipedia blocks them as a preventive measure — even if you personally haven't done anything wrong. How to fix it: Turn off VPNs, proxies, or tools like iCloud Private Relay (for Apple users) or Microsoft Edge Secure Network . This is the most frequent reason users encounter this block. Try a different connection. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or use a home network instead of a public or work one. Whitelist Wikipedia. You may be able to whitelist Wikipedia from your VPN so that connections to Wikipedia aren't through a VPN service. Instructions for whitelisting Wikipedia on iCloud Private Relay can be found here . Still blocked? If you believe you are not running an anonymizing proxy or Tor, you should consider checking the configuration to make sure it is accurate. Sometimes the configuration for your network is changed without your knowledge, sometimes by malware. In truly exceptional circumstances, you may request IP block exemption . Approval is limited and based on specific criteria, and you should only request it if you have no other way to edit Wikipedia. Note : These blocks are about the type of internet connection, not your actions. We appreciate good-faith contributors and want to help you get editing again. How to appeal if you are confident that your connection does not use a colocation provider's IP address: If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page : {{ unblock |reason=Caught by a colocation web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. My IP address is _______. Place any further information here. ~~~~}} . You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here . Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system . There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. Information for administrators: Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests . Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator. This block will expire on 17:40, 25 September 2027. Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page , as well as email administrators and other editors. For information on how to proceed, please read the FAQ for blocked users and the guideline on block appeals . The guide to appealing blocks may also be helpful.

Unlike pure word-of-mouth strategies—where customers independently share information without company involvement or ability to track—referral marketing actively incentivizes and rewards existing customers for referring new ones, allowing the company to influence, track, and measure the referral process. The process is distinct from multi-level marketing , in that there is no incentive for the original existing customer to drive or influence the subsequent referrals of the new customer [ clarification needed ] – only the conversion of the initial, primary customer is rewarded. [ 1 ] Overview [ edit ] Referral marketing is a tool used by businesses and corporations across various industries to grow and build their customer bases. In the past, referral marketing was purely focused on spreading information through verbal interaction with a close network. Modern-day referral marketing now heavily relies on social media and the internet , allowing the scope of referrals to increase dramatically by reaching a far broader audience. [ 2 ] There are three fundamental elements that help define and differentiate referral programs from organic WOM (word of mouth). They are company driven in that they are actively managed by the parent company, which is different from organic WOM which involves the unprompted recommendation for a company's products or services through external interaction, free from company influence. Secondly, an overarching aim is to convert existing customer's networks to join as new customers. Lastly, is a reward or incentive given to the existing customer by the company for the successful conversion of their network to their products and/or services. [ 3 ] Referral programs typically fall into two categories: incentive-based and non-incentive-based. The former is much more common and includes rewards such as cash, prizes, discounts, shopping vouchers or the service itself for a limited time. [ 1 ] For example, telecommunication companies may offer discounts or vouchers to customers and credit card companies may offer redeemable points, coupons or cash for a new service. [ 4 ] The latter referral marketing program benefits the existing customer through increasing reputation and gaining special treatment from the parent company through working without economic payment on presentations and online forums for example . [ 5 ] Referral marketing was questioned by managers for the effectiveness and material benefit it could bring to a company in comparison to organic WOM and other means. Concerns over operating costs of implementing a referral program, unsustainable economic benefits, suspicion on the trustworthiness of the referee given the monetary incentive to recommend, as well as abuse from opportunistic referrers all questioned the value of referral marketing brings to a company. [ 3 ] Online referral marketing [ edit ] Online referral marketing is the internet-based, or Software as a Service (SaaS) approach, to traditional referral marketing. By tracking customer behavior online through the use of web browser cookies and similar technology, online referral marketing can potentially increase brand awareness, referrals and, ultimately, revenue. Many platforms allow organizations to see their referral marketing return on investment (ROI), and to optimize their campaigns to improve results. Many of the newest systems provide users with the same experience whether they are on a desktop or mobile device. Offline referral marketers sometimes use trackable business cards. Trackable business cards typically contain QR codes linking them to online content for sale while providing a way to track that sale back to the person whose card was scanned. Online referral marketing focuses on interactions between customers. [ 6 ] The Internet is a common channel for referral-based marketing. It delivers abundant outlets for customers to share their opinions, product favourites, and experiences, including the company's website and through social media. The marketers can encourage the referring parties by providing pre-scripted messages. Advocates can provide their family members and friends with personalised links including unique referral codes and advertisement information through e-mails, blogs and instant messages. The company can give rewards to advocates when their family members and friends buy through the link. [ 1 ] These same technologies also help companies set up a system that integrates referrals into the marketing plan. By tracking user traffic, the companies can offer referrals to other online customers. [ 6 ] Advantages [ edit ] There are multiple advantages to referral programs. Typically, referral customers are better matched due to the existing customer knowing both parties and able to determine the benefits to the potential new customer; given the product or service is useful to the referrer, the prospect has a higher chance of also finding it useful. This brings higher value customers to the company or authority at a lower cost. [ 1 ] With a referral from a close tie, there are implications on the referrer's reputation if the product or service is not well-received, given the higher value placed on a personal recommendation rather than an advertisement. Thus, it is in the referrer's best interest to recommend a product or service that is not only useful to the potential prospect but also something that they themselves have used. [ 3 ] Literature has determined that the customer value and contribution derived from referral programs are higher for a firm than those sourced from other means. [ 3 ] They can also serve as a tool to measure the health of customer satisfaction. High-performing referral programs or a high magnitude of referrers may indicate high customer satisfaction and vice versa. [ 1 ] Referral programs can help establish long-term relations with customers by matching customer motivations and expectations with referring new customers. [ 7 ] This way, referral programs can also be regarded as a tool for retaining existing customers. [ 8 ] Disadvantages [ edit ] The referrer may not be impartial if compensation is based on the prospect joining the customer, not just for the referral. Incentives can place an ulterior motive on the referrer's end, which can introduce a drive to 'sell' referrals in order to receive compensation. This can result in uncertainty from the referred customer, and reduce trust in both the existing customer and company regardless of the product or service sold. This does not happen with pure WOM given that there are no incentives given to referrers by a company to recommend. [ 1 ] A large majority of referral marketing programs will compensate regardless of the longevity or quality of the new customer; this creates a moral hazard favoring opportunists and potentially harms the genuineness of the recommendations. [ 9 ] Referrers can spread referrals to a wide audience, either offline or online, and introduce low quality customers to the business with no consequence. [ 9 ] However, this abuse is offset by the benefits of the referral marketing program and companies should still consider the implementation. Depending on the size of the reward, referrers may also knowingly recommend to their network a poor service or product. [ 3 ] Referral programs are not free and have operational costs to acquire new customers. Administrative costs, software with databases to recognize and trace purchasers, advertisement campaigns and incentive costs are just some of these. [ 2 ] It does require additional time and resources to set up and manage on a day to day basis. Effectiveness of referral marketing [ edit ] A study in 2010 by the University of Pennsylvania and Goethe University Frankfurt aimed to determine the relationship between the value a customer brings to a business through online referral marketing versus other methods by answering four questions: \"Are referred customers more valuable?\" \"Is the difference in customer value large enough to cover the costs of such stimulated WOM customer acquisition efforts?\" \"Are customers acquired through a referral program more valuable because they generate higher margins, exhibit higher retention, or both?\" \"Do differences in margins and retention remain stable or do they erode?\" [ 3 ] This study followed the online referral program of a bank in Germany and saw that each referral by an existing customer would result in a 25 euro reward. The results determined that referred customers were both more profitable and loyal than normal customers. Referred customers had a higher contribution margin, a higher retention rate and were more valuable overall in both the short and long term – 16% more in profits and 25% more valuable. A referred customer had an 82% chance of being an active customer after 33 months in comparison to 79.2%. However, it was found that the program was less effective in referring individuals over the age of 55 or low-margin customers. [ 3 ] The study suggested that while there are disadvantages associated with referral marketing, the overall benefits may outweigh these drawbacks, indicating that referral programs can be effective for customer base growth. It also noted that referral programs can better target high value customers who are more likely to retain the service provided, at a lower cost than conventional marketing means. In terms of the referrer, they found that firms should make the reward a function of the value of the existing customer instead of following their own competitors. [ 3 ] Referral marketing reward structure [ edit ] A study in 2019 by Harvard Business School , Washington University in St. Louis and University of California, San Diego aimed to find the highest converting reward structure for referral marketing. The study examines five incentive structures: No-incentive (control) Sender-benefiting Recipient-benefiting Shared Donations [ 10 ] The study found that recipient-benefiting incentive structures convert 1.41 - 1.79 times more than sender-benefiting structures. Additionally shared incentive structures converted at similar rates of recipient-benefiting structures. No-incentive and donation structures converted at substantially lower levels than all other options. [ 10 ] Double vs single sided rewards [ edit ] There are two main types of referral programs: A single-sided referral program and a double-sided referral program. A single-sided referral program is one that only offers a referral bonus or reward to the person who is making the referral. Usually, this person would be an existing customer or the referrer Whereas a double-sided referral program offers a referral reward to the person making the referrals as well as a referral incentive to the friend, colleague, or family member that has been referred. Also known as the referee or the person invited. Double-sided referral programs are generally more successful than single sided ones. This is because customers feel much more comfortable making referrals when they know that the person they are referring will also benefit in some way. This doesn’t always have to be a cash incentive, it could be an upgrade to your business, a free gift, or even access to exclusive content. Additionally, if a friend or family member receives a discount or incentive of sorts, it increases the likelihood that they will choose one business over another.

For Media attention inequality, see Media bias . Attention inequality is the inequality of distribution of attention across users on social networks, [ 1 ] people in general, [ 2 ] and for scientific papers. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Yun Family Foundation introduced \"Attention Inequality Coefficient\" as a measure of inequality in attention and arguments it by the close interconnection with wealth inequality . [ 5 ] Relationship to economic inequality [ edit ] Attention inequality is related to economic inequality since attention is an economically scarce good. [ 2 ] [ 6 ] The same measures and concepts as in classical economy can be applied for attention economy . The relationship develops also beyond the conceptual level—considering the AIDA process, attention is the prerequisite for real monetary income on the Internet. [ 7 ] On data of 2018, [ 8 ] a significant relationship between likes and comments on Facebook to donations is proven for non-profit organizations . Extent [ edit ] As data of 2008 shows, 50% of the attention is concentrated on approximately 0.2% of all hostnames , and 80% on 5% of hostnames. [ 6 ] The Gini coefficient of attention distribution lay in 2008 at over 0.921 for such commercial domains names as ac.jp and at 0.985 for .org-domains . The Gini coefficient was measured on Twitter in 2016 for the number of followers as 0.9412, for the number of mentions as 0.9133, and for the number of retweets as 0.9034. For comparison, the world's income Gini coefficient was 0.68 in 2005 and 0.904 in 2018. More than 96% of all followers, 93% of the retweets, and 93% of all mentions are owned by 20% of Twitter. [ 1 ] Causes [ edit ] At least for scientific papers, today's consensus states that inequality is unexplainable by variations of quality and individual talent. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The Matthew effect plays a significant role in the emergence of attention inequality—those who already enjoy large amounts of attention get even more attention, and those who do not lose even more. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Ranking algorithms based on relevance to the user have been found to alleviate the inequality of the number of posts across topics.

It was introduced by Leo Katz in 1953 and is used to measure the relative degree of influence of an actor (or node) within a social network . [ 1 ] Unlike typical centrality measures which consider only the shortest path (the geodesic ) between a pair of actors, Katz centrality measures influence by taking into account the total number of walks between a pair of actors. [ 2 ] It is similar to Google 's PageRank and to the eigenvector centrality . [ 3 ] Measurement [ edit ] A simple social network: the nodes represent people or actors and the edges between nodes represent some relationship between actors Katz centrality computes the relative influence of a node within a network by measuring the number of the immediate neighbors (first degree nodes) and also all other nodes in the network that connect to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors. Connections made with distant neighbors are, however, penalized by an attenuation factor α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } . [ 4 ] Each path or connection between a pair of nodes is assigned a weight determined by α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } and the distance between nodes as α d {\\displaystyle \\alpha ^{d}} . For example, in the figure on the right, assume that John's centrality is being measured and that α = 0.5 {\\displaystyle \\alpha =0.5} . The weight assigned to each link that connects John with his immediate neighbors Jane and Bob will be ( 0.5 ) 1 = 0.5 {\\displaystyle (0.5)^{1}=0.5} . Since Jose connects to John indirectly through Bob, the weight assigned to this connection (composed of two links) will be ( 0.5 ) 2 = 0.25 {\\displaystyle (0.5)^{2}=0.25} . Similarly, the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Aziz and Jane will be ( 0.5 ) 3 = 0.125 {\\displaystyle (0.5)^{3}=0.125} and the weight assigned to the connection between Agneta and John through Diego, Jose and Bob will be ( 0.5 ) 4 = 0.0625 {\\displaystyle (0.5)^{4}=0.0625} . Mathematical formulation [ edit ] Let A be the adjacency matrix of a network under consideration. Elements ( a i j ) {\\displaystyle (a_{ij})} of A are variables that take a value 1 if a node i is connected to node j and 0 otherwise. The powers of A indicate the presence (or absence) of links between two nodes through intermediaries. For instance, in matrix A 3 {\\displaystyle A^{3}} , if element ( a 2 , 12 ) = 1 {\\displaystyle (a_{2,12})=1} , it indicates that node 2 and node 12 are connected through some walk of length 3. If C K a t z ( i ) {\\displaystyle C_{\\mathrm {Katz} }(i)} denotes Katz centrality of a node i , then, given a value α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) {\\displaystyle \\alpha \\in (0,1)} , mathematically: C K a t z ( i ) = ∑ k = 1 ∞ ∑ j = 1 n α k ( A k ) j i {\\displaystyle C_{\\mathrm {Katz} }(i)=\\sum _{k=1}^{\\infty }\\sum _{j=1}^{n}\\alpha ^{k}(A^{k})_{ji}} Note that the above definition uses the fact that the element at location ( i , j ) {\\displaystyle (i,j)} of A k {\\displaystyle A^{k}} reflects the total number of k {\\displaystyle k} degree connections between nodes i {\\displaystyle i} and j {\\displaystyle j} . The value of the attenuation factor α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } has to be chosen such that it is smaller than the reciprocal of the absolute value of the largest eigenvalue of A . [ 5 ] In this case the following expression can be used to calculate Katz centrality: C → K a t z = ( ( I − α A T ) − 1 − I ) I → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {C}}_{\\mathrm {Katz} }=((I-\\alpha A^{T})^{-1}-I){\\overrightarrow {I}}} Here I {\\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix, I → {\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {I}}} is a vector of size n ( n is the number of nodes) consisting of ones. A T {\\displaystyle A^{T}} denotes the transposed matrix of A and ( I − α A T ) − 1 {\\displaystyle (I-\\alpha A^{T})^{-1}} denotes matrix inversion of the term ( I − α A T ) {\\displaystyle (I-\\alpha A^{T})} . [ 5 ] An extension of this framework allows for the walks to be computed in a dynamical setting. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] By taking a time dependent series of network adjacency snapshots of the transient edges, the dependency for walks to contribute towards a cumulative effect is presented. The arrow of time is preserved so that the contribution of activity is asymmetric in the direction of information propagation. Network producing data of the form: { A [ k ] ∈ R N × N } for k = 0 , 1 , 2 , … , M , {\\displaystyle \\left\\{A^{[k]}\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{N\\times N}\\right\\}\\qquad {\\text{for}}\\quad k=0,1,2,\\ldots ,M,} representing the adjacency matrix at each time t k {\\displaystyle t_{k}} . Hence: ( A [ k ] ) i j = { 1 there is an edge from node i to node j at time t k 0 otherwise {\\displaystyle \\left(A^{[k]}\\right)_{ij}={\\begin{cases}1&{\\text{there is an edge from node }}i{\\text{ to node }}j{\\text{ at time }}t_{k}\\\\0&{\\text{otherwise}}\\end{cases}}} The time points t 0 < t 1 < ⋯ < t M {\\displaystyle t_{0}<t_{1}<\\cdots <t_{M}} are ordered but not necessarily equally spaced. Q ∈ R N × N {\\displaystyle Q\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{N\\times N}} for which ( Q ) i j {\\displaystyle (Q)_{ij}} is a weighted count of the number of dynamic walks of length w {\\displaystyle w} from node i {\\displaystyle i} to node j {\\displaystyle j} . The form for the dynamic communicability between participating nodes is: Q = ( I − α A [ 0 ] ) − 1 ⋯ ( I − α A [ M ] ) − 1 . {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {Q}}=\\left(I-\\alpha A^{[0]}\\right)^{-1}\\cdots \\left(I-\\alpha A^{[M]}\\right)^{-1}.} This can be normalized via: Q ^ [ k ] = Q ^ [ k − 1 ] ( I − α A [ k ] ) − 1 ‖ Q ^ [ k − 1 ] ( I − α A [ k ] ) − 1 ‖ . {\\displaystyle {\\hat {\\mathcal {Q}}}^{[k]}={\\frac {{\\hat {\\mathcal {Q}}}^{[k-1]}\\left(I-\\alpha A^{[k]}\\right)^{-1}}{\\left\\|{\\hat {\\mathcal {Q}}}^{[k-1]}\\left(I-\\alpha A^{[k]}\\right)^{-1}\\right\\|}}.} Therefore, centrality measures that quantify how effectively node n {\\displaystyle n} can 'broadcast' and 'receive' dynamic messages across the network: C n b r o a d c a s t := ∑ k = 1 N Q n k a n d C n r e c e i v e := ∑ k = 1 N Q k n {\\displaystyle C_{n}^{\\mathrm {broadcast} }:=\\sum _{k=1}^{N}{\\mathcal {Q}}_{nk}\\quad \\mathrm {and} \\quad C_{n}^{\\mathrm {receive} }:=\\sum _{k=1}^{N}{\\mathcal {Q}}_{kn}} . Alpha centrality [ edit ] Given a graph with adjacency matrix A i , j {\\displaystyle A_{i,j}} , Katz centrality is defined as follows: x → = ( I − α A T ) − 1 e → − e → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {x}}=(I-\\alpha A^{T})^{-1}{\\vec {e}}-{\\vec {e}}\\,} where e j {\\displaystyle e_{j}} is the external importance given to node j {\\displaystyle j} , and α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } is a nonnegative attenuation factor which must be smaller than the inverse of the spectral radius of A {\\displaystyle A} . The original definition by Katz [ 8 ] used a constant vector e → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {e}}} . Hubbell [ 9 ] introduced the usage of a general e → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {e}}} . Half a century later, Bonacich and Lloyd [ 10 ] defined alpha centrality as: x → = ( I − α A T ) − 1 e → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {x}}=(I-\\alpha A^{T})^{-1}{\\vec {e}}\\,} which is essentially identical to Katz centrality. More precisely, the score of a node j {\\displaystyle j} differs exactly by e j {\\displaystyle e_{j}} , so if e → {\\displaystyle {\\vec {e}}} is constant the order induced on the nodes is identical. Applications [ edit ] Katz centrality can be used to compute centrality in directed networks such as citation networks and the World Wide Web. [ 11 ] Katz centrality is more suitable in the analysis of directed acyclic graphs where traditionally used measures like eigenvector centrality are rendered useless. [ 11 ] Katz centrality can also be used in estimating the relative status or influence of actors in a social network. The work presented in [ 12 ] shows the case study of applying a dynamic version of the Katz centrality to data from Twitter and focuses on particular brands which have stable discussion leaders. The application allows for a comparison of the methodology with that of human experts in the field and how the results are in agreement with a panel of social media experts. In neuroscience , it is found that Katz centrality correlates with the relative firing rate of neurons in a neural network. [ 13 ] The temporal extension of the Katz centrality is applied to fMRI data obtained from a musical learning experiment in [ 14 ] where data is collected from the subjects before and after the learning process. The results show that the changes to the network structure over the musical exposure created in each session a quantification of the cross communicability that produced clusters in line with the success of learning. A generalized form of Katz centrality can be used as an intuitive ranking system for sports teams, such as in college football . [ 15 ] Alpha centrality is implemented in igraph library for network analysis and visualization. [ 16 ] References [ edit ] ^ Katz, L. (1953). A New Status Index Derived from Sociometric Analysis.

[ 9 ] It has been referred to as \"the most powerful company in the world\" by the BBC [ 10 ] and is one of the world's most valuable brands . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. , is one of the five Big Tech companies alongside Amazon , Apple , Meta , and Microsoft . Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin . Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock . The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet. [ 14 ] After the success of its original service, Google Search (often known simply as \"Google\"), the company has rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services . These products address a wide range of use cases, including email ( Gmail ), navigation and mapping ( Waze , Maps , and Earth ), cloud computing ( Cloud ), web navigation ( Chrome ), video sharing ( YouTube ), productivity ( Workspace ), operating systems ( Android and ChromeOS ), cloud storage ( Drive ), language translation ( Translate ), photo storage ( Photos ), videotelephony ( Meet ), smart home ( Nest ), smartphones ( Pixel ), wearable technology ( Pixel Watch and Fitbit ), music streaming ( YouTube Music ), video on demand ( YouTube TV ), AI ( Google Assistant and Gemini ), machine learning APIs ( TensorFlow ), AI chips ( TPU ), and more. Many of these products and services are dominant in their respective industries, as is Google Search. Discontinued Google products include gaming ( Stadia ), [ 15 ] Glass , Google+ , Reader , Play Music , Nexus , Hangouts , and Inbox by Gmail . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Google's other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing ( Sycamore ), self-driving cars ( Waymo ), smart cities ( Sidewalk Labs ), and transformer models ( Google DeepMind ). [ 18 ] Google Search and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide, followed by Facebook and Twitter (now known as X). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider , office suite , online video platform , photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system , web browser , machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. [ 19 ] On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes as of January 2022 [ 20 ] and fourth by Interbrand as of February 2022. [ 21 ] The company has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns , tax avoidance , censorship , search neutrality , antitrust , and abuse of its monopoly position. [ 22 ] History Main articles: History of Google and List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet See also: Alphabet Inc. Early years Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003 Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California , USA . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The project initially involved an unofficial \"third founder\", Scott Hassan , the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Then Chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt (left) with co-founders Sergey Brin (center) and Larry Page (right) in 2008 Google's original homepage had a simplistic design because the company founders had little experience in HTML , the markup language used for designing web pages [ 30 ] While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. [ 31 ] They called this algorithm PageRank ; it determined a website's relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. [ 32 ] [ 31 ] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page's ideas. [ 26 ] Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki 's garage as their office when the search engine was set up in 1998. [ 33 ] Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine \"BackRub\" because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. [ 23 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Hassan, as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. [ 36 ] PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex , developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Eventually, they changed the name to Google ; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word googol , [ 23 ] [ 39 ] [ 40 ] a very large number written 10 100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information. [ 41 ] Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim , [ 23 ] co-founder of Sun Microsystems . This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim . The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco , where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Google received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos , and entrepreneur Ram Shriram . [ 46 ] Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google's founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google's initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos' status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] Between these initial investors, friends and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California . [ 49 ] Craig Silverstein , a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee. [ 25 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, [ 46 ] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, [ 52 ] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital . [ 43 ] Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google's great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies. [ 53 ] Growth In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California , [ 54 ] which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups. [ 55 ] The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine. [ 56 ] [ 25 ] To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based. [ 57 ] In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo! , one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Google's first production server [ 60 ] In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics , at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California . [ 61 ] The complex became known as the Googleplex , a play on the word googolplex , the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million. [ 62 ] By that time, the name \"Google\" had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb \" google \" to be added to the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary , denoted as: \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet\". [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer . [ 65 ] Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google. [ 49 ] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed. [ 66 ] Initial public offering On August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering. At that time Page, Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024. [ 67 ] The company opened on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol GOOGL with an offering of 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse , underwriters for the deal. [ 70 ] [ 71 ] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion. [ 72 ] Eric Schmidt , CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 On October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock, [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion for the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC . [ 77 ] On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently. [ 49 ] In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] In May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in its largest acquisition to date. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies, [ 85 ] mainly Apple and Microsoft , [ 86 ] and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android. [ 87 ] 2012 onwards In June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million. [ 88 ] While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps , Google's own mapping service. [ 89 ] Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico , on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson . In the official public statement, Page explained that the \"health and well-being\" company would focus on \"the challenge of ageing and associated diseases\". [ 90 ] Entrance of building where Google and its subsidiary Deep Mind are located at 6 Pancras Square, London On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies , a privately held AI company from London . [ 91 ] Technology news website Recode reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google's recent growth in the AI and robotics community. [ 94 ] In 2015, DeepMind's AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go. According to Interbrand's annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013, [ 95 ] 2014, [ 96 ] 2015, [ 97 ] and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion. [ 98 ] On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet's largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Current CEO, Sundar Pichai , with Prime Minister of India , Narendra Modi On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and \" Google's Ideological Echo Chamber \" clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions. [ 102 ] Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by \"advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace\", and he was fired on the same day. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Between 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company's leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly , a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven , a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] On October 25, 2018, The New York Times published the exposé , \"How Google Protected Andy Rubin , the 'Father of Android'\". The company subsequently announced that \"48 employees have been fired over the last two years\" for sexual misconduct. [ 108 ] On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests. [ 111 ] Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists. [ 107 ] On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia . [ 112 ] On June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations. [ 113 ] This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets. [ 114 ] In December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google's new commerce chief. Ready's role will not be directly involved with Google Pay . [ 115 ] In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic , Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel. [ 116 ] Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home [ 117 ] The 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube , and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees. [ 121 ] In January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia. [ 122 ] In March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia. [ 123 ] Google spent \"tens of millions of dollars\" on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia. [ 124 ] In April 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that Google ran a years-long program called \"Project Bernanke\" that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December. [ 125 ] In September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google's capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers. [ 126 ] In 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is \"broadly useful\", such as news articles, or already part of the public record. [ 127 ] In May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up company Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google's Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner, [ 130 ] [ 131 ] a Go tool for finding security holes in open source software , which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend against supply chain attacks. Following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google's senior management issued a \"code red\" [ 132 ] and a \"directive that all of its most important products—those with more than a billion users—must incorporate generative AI within months\". [ 133 ] In March 2023, in direct response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini ), a generative artificial intelligence chatbot . [ 134 ] In early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company's tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google's total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion. [ 135 ] In August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search. [ 136 ] D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta held that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act . [ 137 ] In September 2024, the EU Court of Justice , based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with regards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a €2.4 billion fine. [ 138 ] The EU Court of Justice found that Google's treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as \"discriminatory\", was in violation of the Digital Markets Act . [ 138 ] In October 2024, Google was fined by a local Russian court a symbolic 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda. No payment was made. [ 139 ] In November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new AI hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to support the Kingdom's economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia's economy by advancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region's specific needs and training local talent. [ 140 ] The partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as the Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare, finance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an emphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption. [ 141 ] In March 2025, Google agreed to acquire Wiz , a New York-based cybersecurity startup focusing on cloud computing, for US$32 billion. This cash deal would be Google's biggest ever, as well as it currently being the most expensive deal of 2025. Alphabet reportedly tried to close a deal for only $23 billion in 2024, but this fell apart after concerns about regulatory hurdles, among other issues. Wiz, a company located in the U.S. and Israel, was cofounded in 2020 by Assaf Rappaport . The company is backed by a number of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, as well as notably being partnered with Amazon and Microsoft, as listed in their website. Google reportedly said \"the deal would help artificial-intelligence companies get better security and use more than one cloud service.\" [ 142 ] In July 2025, the United States Department of Defense announced that Google had received a $200 million contract for AI in the military, along with Anthropic , OpenAI , and xAI . [ 143 ] In September 2025, federal judge Amit Mehta in the United States ruled that Google will not be required to divest Chrome or the Android operating system. [ 144 ] However, the ruling barred Google from having exclusive contracts for Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant and Gemini app products, and ruled Google must share search data with competitors. [ 145 ] Products and services Main article: List of Google products Search engine Main articles: Google Search and Google Images Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators . [ 146 ] According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%. [ 147 ] In May 2017, Google enabled a new \"Personal\" tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts' various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites. [ 150 ] Google also hosts Google Books , a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed. [ 151 ] Google expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002), [ 152 ] finance (launched 2006), [ 153 ] and flights (launched 2011). [ 154 ] Advertising Google at ad-tech London, 2010 Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob , AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange. [ 155 ] In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick , to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history. [ 156 ] [ 157 ] In 2007, Google launched \" AdSense for Mobile \", taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market. [ 158 ] Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page. [ 159 ] Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme. [ 160 ] The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked. [ 161 ] One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud , which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid. [ 162 ] Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website's visibility. Generative artificial intelligence Google had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots , such as Google Bard, prior to the announcement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate competitors to ChatGPT , unlike Gemini. [ 163 ] An AI training program for Google employees was also introduced in April 2024. [ 164 ] Google has created the text-to-image model Imagen , [ 165 ] and the text-to-video model Veo. [ 166 ] In 2025, Google announced SynthID Detector, a tool that uses watermarking to identify whether content such as text, images, audio, or video was generated using Google products. [ 167 ] In 2023, Google released NotebookLM , an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In September 2024, it gained attention for its \"Audio Overview\" feature, which generates podcast-like summaries of documents. [ 168 ] [ 169 ] Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving as personal AI tutors . [ 170 ] Consumer services Web-based services See also: Firebase Studio and Google Colab Google offers Gmail for email , [ 171 ] Google Calendar for time-management and scheduling, [ 172 ] Google Maps and Google Earth for mapping, navigation and satellite imagery , [ 173 ] Google Drive for cloud storage of files, [ 174 ] Google Docs , Sheets and Slides for productivity, [ 174 ] Google Photos for photo storage and sharing, [ 175 ] Google Keep for note-taking , [ 176 ] Google Translate for language translation, [ 177 ] YouTube for video viewing and sharing, [ 178 ] Google My Business for managing public business information, [ 179 ] Google Classroom for managing assignments and communication in education, [ 180 ] and Duo for social interaction. [ 181 ] A job search product has also existed since before 2017, [ 182 ] [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Google for Jobs is an enhanced search feature that aggregates listings from job boards and career sites. [ 185 ] Google Earth , launched in 2005, allows users to see high-definition satellite pictures from all over the world for free through a client software downloaded to their computers. [ 186 ] Software Google develops the Android mobile operating system , [ 187 ] as well as its smartwatch , [ 188 ] television , [ 189 ] car , [ 190 ] and Internet of things -enabled smart devices variations. [ 191 ] It also develops the Google Chrome web browser, [ 192 ] and ChromeOS , an operating system based on Chrome. [ 193 ] Hardware Google Pixel smartphones on display in a store In January 2010, Google released Nexus One , the first Android phone under its own brand. [ 194 ] It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the \" Nexus \" branding [ 195 ] until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel . [ 196 ] In 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS . [ 197 ] In July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions. [ 198 ] [ 199 ] In June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard , a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media. [ 200 ] In October 2016, Google announced Daydream View , a lightweight VR viewer which lets the user place their smartphone in the front hinge to view VR media. [ 201 ] [ 202 ] Other hardware products include: Nest , a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home [ 203 ] (later succeeded by the Nest Audio ), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini ), the Google Home Max , the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max . Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi. [ 204 ] Enterprise services Main articles: Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform Google Workspace (formerly G Suite until October 2020 [ 205 ] ) is a monthly subscription offering for organizations and businesses to get access to a collection of Google's services, including Gmail, Google Drive and Google Docs , Google Sheets and Google Slides , with additional administrative tools, unique domain names, and 24/7 support. [ 206 ] On September 24, 2012, [ 207 ] Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs , a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships. [ 208 ] Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin , London , Madrid , Seoul , São Paulo , Tel Aviv , and Warsaw . On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, \"a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers\" which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help \"enterprise class marketers\" \"see the complete customer journey \", generate \"useful insights\", and \"deliver engaging experiences to the right people\". [ 209 ] Jack Marshall of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe , Oracle , Salesforce , and IBM . [ 210 ] Internet services In February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities. [ 211 ] [ 212 ] Following Google's corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet's Access division. [ 213 ] [ 214 ] In April 2015, Google announced Project Fi , a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal. [ 215 ] [ 216 ] Financial services In August 2023, Google became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation , launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets. [ 217 ] Corporate affairs Business trends See also: Alphabet Inc. § Finances From the financial year of 2015, figures are published for Alphabet Inc. Until 2014, the key trends of Google were (as at the financial year ending December 31): [ 218 ] [ 219 ] FY Revenue Net income Employees [ 220 ] [ 221 ] References in million USD 1999 0.22 −6.0 [ 222 ] 2000 19.1 −14.6 [ 223 ] 2001 86.4 6.9 284 [ 223 ] 2002 439 99.6 682 [ 223 ] in billion USD 2003 1.4 0.10 1,628 [ 223 ] 2004 3.1 0.39 3,021 [ 223 ] 2005 6.1 1.4 5,680 2006 10.6 3.0 10,674 2007 16.5 4.2 16,805 2008 21.8 4.2 20,222 2009 23.6 6.5 19,835 2010 29,3 8.5 24,400 2011 37.9 9.7 32,467 2012 46.0 10.7 53,861 2013 55.5 12.7 47,756 2014 66.0 14.1 53,600 Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. [ 68 ] [ 69 ] The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion. [ 72 ] The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, [ 224 ] primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market. [ 225 ] The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds . [ 225 ] GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares . [ 226 ] The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google's holding company, since the fourth quarter of 2015. [update] [ 227 ] In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] [ 230 ] For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues. [ 231 ] In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs. [ 232 ] Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, \"We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year – not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.\" [ 233 ] Google's consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. [ 234 ] Google's Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users' clicks on advertisements. [ 235 ] By January 2014, Google's market capitalization had grown to $397 billion. [ 236 ] Tax avoidance strategies Further information: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland § Multinational tax schemes , and Google tax Google uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue , it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda . Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent. [ 237 ] This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's transfer pricing practices in 2012. [ 238 ] In 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the U.S. [ 239 ] Google Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK. [ 240 ] In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future. [ 241 ] In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill. [ 242 ] In 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections. [ 243 ] Corporate identity Further information: History of Google § Name , Google (verb) , Google logo , Google Doodle , List of Google April Fools' Day jokes , and List of Google Easter eggs Google's logo from 2013 to 2015. The logo had been used with minor changes since 1999. The name \"Google\" originated from a misspelling of \" googol \", [ 244 ] [ 245 ] which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank : [ 36 ] \"We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10 100 [,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.\" Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb \"google\" was added to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006, meaning \"to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.\" [ 246 ] [ 64 ] Google's mission statement , from the outset, was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful\", [ 247 ] and its unofficial slogan is \" Don't be evil \". [ 248 ] In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: \"Do the right thing\". [ 249 ] The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet. The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin. [ 250 ] Since 1998, [update] Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. [ 251 ] [ 252 ] The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then- intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed \"Doodlers\". [ 253 ] Google has a tradition of creating April Fools' Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web. [ 254 ] In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP , or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet. [ 255 ] Google's services contain easter eggs , such as the Swedish Chef 's \"Bork bork bork\", Pig Latin , \"Hacker\" or leetspeak , Elmer Fudd , Pirate , and Klingon as language selections for its search engine. [ 256 ] When searching for the word \" anagram \", meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays \"Did you mean: nag a ram?\" [ 257 ] Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better. [ 258 ] Workplace culture Google employees marching in the Pride in London parade in 2016 On Fortune magazine's list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012, [ 259 ] [ 260 ] [ 261 ] and fourth in 2009 and 2010. [ 262 ] [ 263 ] Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world's most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index. [ 264 ] Google's corporate philosophy includes principles such as \"you can make money without doing evil\", \"you can be serious without a suit\", and \"work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun\". [ 265 ] As of September 30, 2020, [update] Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees, [ 266 ] of which more than 100,000 worked for Google. [ 8 ] Google's 2020 [update] diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%). [ 267 ] Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women. [ 268 ] In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, as of March 2019. [update] [ 8 ] Google's employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range \"from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six\". [ 269 ] As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off , where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google's services, such as Gmail, Google News , Orkut , and AdSense , originated from these independent endeavors. [ 270 ] In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer , Google's vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off. [ 271 ] In 2005, articles in The New York Times [ 272 ] and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] In an effort to maintain the company's unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on. [ 276 ] Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees. [ 277 ] [ 278 ] In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged \"no cold call\" agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees. [ 279 ] In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their \"conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race\". [ 280 ] On January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced. [ 281 ] The coalition is made up of \"13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland\". [ 282 ] The group is affiliated with the UNI Global Union , which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture. [ 282 ] [ 283 ] [ 280 ] Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union. [ 284 ] In 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to \"convince them (employees) that unions suck\". [ 285 ] In February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make \" diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do\" from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald's, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes. [ 286 ] Office locations Further information: Googleplex Google's New York City office building houses its largest advertising sales team. Google's Toronto office Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as \"the Googleplex\", a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a complex of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries. [ 287 ] In 2006, Google moved into about 300,000 square feet (27,900 m 2 ) of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan , New York City . The office houses its largest advertising sales team. [ 288 ] In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion. [ 289 ] [ 290 ] In March 2018, Google's parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York. [ 291 ] [ 292 ] [ 293 ] [ 294 ] In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees. [ 295 ] The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, 1,700,000-square-foot (160,000 m 2 ) headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan's Hudson Square neighborhood. [ 296 ] [ 297 ] Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City. [ 298 ] By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan . [ 299 ] In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon 's campus in Pittsburgh , focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs. [ 300 ] [ 301 ] Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta ; Austin ; Boulder, Colorado ; Cambridge, Massachusetts ; San Francisco ; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington ; Birmingham, Michigan ; Reston, Virginia , Washington, D.C. , [ 302 ] and Madison, Wisconsin . [ 303 ] Google's Dublin Ireland office, headquarters of Google Ads for Europe It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps) [ 304 ] and London (part of Android development). [ 305 ] In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal's announcement in January, [ 306 ] Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017. [ 307 ] [ 308 ] In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad , India. The new campus, reported to be the company's largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees. [ 309 ] [ 310 ] Google's Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide, [ 311 ] with 32 offices in North America, three of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google's offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK ). The Asia Pacific region counts with 26 offices principally five in India and three in Australia , three in China , and the Africa Middle East region counts five offices.

[ 313 ] There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. [ 314 ] Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low. [ 315 ] [ 316 ] [ 317 ] In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009. [ 317 ] Google has built its own private submarine communications cables . The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019. [ 318 ] [ 319 ] The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020. [ 320 ] Google's third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon ( Portugal ) with Lagos ( Nigeria ) and Cape Town ( South Africa ). [ 321 ] The company's fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York (US), Bude ( UK ) and Bilbao ( Spain ), and is expected to become operational in 2022. [ 322 ] Environment In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. [ 323 ] Since 2007, [update] Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations. [ 325 ] In Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn. It was apparently more eco-friendly. [ 326 ] Google disclosed in September 2011 that it \"continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes\", almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant . Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google. [ 327 ] In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota . The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. [ 328 ] In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. [ 329 ] The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm. [ 330 ] In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years. [ 331 ] In December 2016, Google announced that—starting in 2017—it would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google \"the world's largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy\". [ 332 ] [ 333 ] [ 334 ] In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy . The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota , one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma . [ 335 ] In September 2019, Google's chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said. [ 336 ] In September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company's foundation in 1998. [ 337 ] It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030. [ 338 ] In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill. [ 339 ] In 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, or Tunisia. [ 340 ] Climate change denial and misinformation Google donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute . [ 341 ] [ 342 ] The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites. [ 343 ] Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites. [ 344 ] Philanthropy Main article: Google.org In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1 billion. [ 345 ] The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change , global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program's executive director in 2004 [ 346 ] and Megan Smith has since [update] replaced him as director. [ 347 ] In March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View. [ 348 ] In 2011, Google donated €1 million to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015). [ 349 ] [ 350 ] In July 2012, Google launched a \" Legalize Love \" campaign in support of gay rights . [ 351 ] In 2008, Google announced its \"project 10 100 \", which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites. [ 352 ] After two years of no update, during which many wondered what had happened to the program, [ 353 ] Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online. [ 354 ] Responding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine , Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens. [ 355 ] The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees. [ 356 ] Also in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up , Social Finance , and Merit America. [ 357 ] Criticism and controversies Further information: Criticism of Google and Google litigation San Francisco activists protest privately owned shuttle buses that transport workers for tech companies such as Google from their homes in San Francisco and Oakland to corporate campuses in Silicon Valley. Google has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance , [ 358 ] search neutrality , copyright , censorship of search results and content, [ 359 ] and privacy . [ 360 ] [ 361 ] Other criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people's intellectual property , concerns that its compilation of data may violate people's privacy , and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly , restraint of trade , anti-competitive practices , and patent infringement . Political controversies United States In a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project— Project Vivian —to counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions. [ 285 ] Brazil On May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti- disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630 , which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country's government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of R$ 1 million (2023) ( US$ 185,528.76 ) per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad. [ 362 ] [ 363 ] Israeli–Palestinian conflict Further information: Israeli–Palestinian conflict Google has a US$1.2 billion artificial intelligence and surveillance contract with the Israeli military known as Project Nimbus . According to Google employees, the Israeli military could use this technology to expand its surveillance of Palestinians living in the occupied territories . [ 364 ] Google relocated an outspoken employee overseas, and the employee claimed it was a \"retaliation for publicly criticizing the contract\". [ 365 ] Other Palestinian employees have described an \"institutionalised bias\" within the company. [ 366 ] Russia On October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a \"symbolic\" fine of $20 decillion on Google for blocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had ordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS . [ 367 ] This comes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of the Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine. [ 368 ] Antitrust See also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Alphabet In July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox . [ 369 ] [ 370 ] In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome. [ 370 ] In 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle. [ 371 ] The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company. Google reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on Safari. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years. [ 372 ] European Union Main article: Antitrust cases against Google by the European Union The European Commission, which imposed three fines on Google in 2017, 2018, and 2019 On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of € 2.42 billion from the European Union for \"promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.\" [ 373 ] On July 18, 2018, [ 374 ] the European Commission fined Google €4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google's constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed [ 375 ] that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union . [ 376 ] On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a €1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to \"compete and innovate fairly\" in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by \"imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites\" that required them to exclude search results from Google's rivals. [ 377 ] [ 378 ] On September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a €4.125 billion (£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google's search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its policy. [ 379 ] In March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese corporations. [ 380 ] Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years, having been hired in 2019. [ 381 ] Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned companies, Google notified the FBI , who carried on the investigation of the data breach . [ 382 ] On September 10, 2024, Europe's top court imposed a €2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its dominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with a complaint from British firm Foundem. [ 383 ] On September 18, 2024, Alphabet's Google won a €1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the European Union, while Qualcomm's efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court agreed with many of the European Commission's findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the Commission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or consumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile, Qualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing against Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further. [ 384 ] United States After U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020, [ 385 ] and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives' Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October, [ 386 ] the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising. [ 387 ] [ 388 ] The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones. [ 389 ] Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to \"cooperate and assist one another\" in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices. [ 390 ] [ 391 ] Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market. [ 392 ] In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act . [ 393 ] [ 394 ] On October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its business, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The Justice Department aimed to limit Google's growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended to appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases involving its app store and advertising operations. [ 395 ] In November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google's online search monopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors, and end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The DoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its investments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to consumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming administration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings. [ 396 ] In September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged in anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent rivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as flawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10% of its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have suggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business. [ 397 ] It was ruled in 2025 by US Department of Justice alongside 17 other states that Google operates a monopoly in online advertising technology. The case will now move to a remedies stage which may lead to Alphabet, the owner of Google, being broken up. [ 398 ] Gender discrimination lawsuit In 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California's Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices. [ 399 ] [ 400 ] [ 401 ] Censorship Main articles: Censorship by Google and Google China § Censorship According to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People's Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly ) \"that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest\". [ 402 ] Google was grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later. [ 403 ] [ 404 ] The project was canceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the company. [ 405 ] [ 406 ] Data loss In May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper 's $135 billion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access their accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted a joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data was compromised and restoration efforts were underway. [ 407 ] Data privacy Further information: Privacy concerns regarding Google and Corporate surveillance On October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to \"non-public\" Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each. [ 408 ] [ 409 ] [ 410 ] On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record €50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation . The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was \"deeply committed\" to transparency and was \"studying the decision\" before determining its response. [ 411 ] In November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale , to assess whether the \"mass collection of individuals' medical records\" complied with HIPAA . [ 412 ] According to The Wall Street Journal , Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis -based healthcare company Ascension . [ 413 ] In early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome's Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history. [ 414 ] [ 415 ] The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google's request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group's charges. [ 416 ] [ 417 ] Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google's CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue. [ 418 ] In April 2024, it was announced that Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately. [ 419 ] On January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet's Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of cookies along with Facebook. [ 420 ] In August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain confidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid requests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer information, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will request confidential treatment of such information from the government. [ 421 ] In January 2025, U.S. federal judge Richard Seeborg rejected Google's motion to dismiss a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit claims Google collected data from users who had specifically opted out of tracking. The trial is scheduled for August 2025. [ 422 ] Geolocation Google has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-sharing settings. [ 423 ] In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about Android devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black Lives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised privacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters. [ 424 ] Copyright infringement On March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content from news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini, violating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly. [ 425 ] U.S. government contracts Following media reports about PRISM , the NSA 's massive electronic surveillance program , in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google. [ 426 ] According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010. [ 427 ] Google has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes . [ 428 ] In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon. [ 429 ] Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019. [ 430 ] In 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle. [ 431 ] See also Outline of Google Googlization Google ATAP Notes ^ Google was incorporated on September 4, 1998, however, since 2002, the company has celebrated its anniversaries on various days in September, most frequently on September 27.

To obey the \"letter of the law\" is to follow the literal reading of the words of the law, whereas following the \"spirit of the law\" is to follow the intention of why the law was enacted. Although it is usual to follow both the letter and the spirit, the two are commonly referenced when they are in opposition. \"Law\" originally referred to legislative statute , [ citation needed ] but in the idiom may refer to any kind of rule. Intentionally following the letter of the law but not the spirit may be accomplished by exploiting technicalities , loopholes , and ambiguous language . Legal research [ edit ] Violating the perceived intention (spirit) of the law has been found to affect people's judgment of culpability more so than the letter of the law, [ 1 ] such that; a person can violate the letter of the law (but not the spirit) and not incur culpability a person can violate the spirit of the law and incur culpability, even without violating the letter of the law the greatest culpability is assigned when both the letter and the spirit of the law are violated Shakespeare [ edit ] Portia and Shylock (1835) by Thomas Sully William Shakespeare wrote numerous plays dealing with the letter-versus-spirit antithesis, almost always coming down on the side of \"spirit\", often forcing villains (who sided with the letter) to make concessions. In one of the best known examples, The Merchant of Venice , he introduces the quibble as a plot device to save both the spirit and the letter of the law. The moneylender Shylock has made an agreement with Antonio that if he cannot repay a loan, he will have a pound of flesh from him. When the debt is not repaid in time, Portia at first pleads for mercy in a famous speech : \"The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\" (IV, i, 185). When Shylock refuses, she finally saves Antonio by pointing out that Shylock's agreement with him mentioned no blood, and therefore Shylock can have his pound of flesh only if he sheds no blood. U.S. constitutional law [ edit ] Interpretations of the U.S. Constitution have historically been divided on the \"letter versus spirit\" debate. For example, at the founding, the Federalist Party argued for a looser interpretation of the Constitution, granting Congress broad powers in keeping with the spirit of the broader purpose of some of the Founding Fathers (notably including the Federalist founders' purposes). The Federalists would have represented the \"spirit\" interpretation. In contrast, the Democratic-Republicans , who favored a limited federal government, argued for the strict interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that the federal government was granted only those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and nothing not explicitly stated; they represented the \"letter\" interpretation. Modern constitutional interpretation is also divided on these lines. Living Constitution scholars advocate for a spiritesque interpretative strategy, although one grounded in a spirit that reflects broad powers. Originalist or textualist scholars advocate a more letter-based approach, arguing that the Amendment process of the Constitution necessarily forecloses broader interpretations that can be accomplished by passing an amendment. The Bible [ edit ] See also: Law and Gospel The 1st century letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians (specifically 2 Corinthians 3:6 ) refers to the spirit and letter of the law. Though it is not quoted directly, the principle is applied using the words \"spirit\" and \"letter\" in context with the legalistic view of the Hebrew Bible . This is the first recorded use of the phrase. [ citation needed ] [ 2 ] In the New Testament , Pharisees are seen as people who place the letter of the law above the spirit ( Mark 2:3–28 , 3:1–6 ). Thus, \"Pharisee\" has entered the language as a pejorative for one who does so; the Oxford English Dictionary defines 'Pharisee' with one of the meanings as \"A person of the spirit or character commonly attributed to the Pharisees in the New Testament; a legalist or formalist\". Pharisees are also depicted as being lawless or corrupt ( Matthew 23:38 ); the Greek word used in the verse means lawlessness , and the corresponding Hebrew word means fraud or injustice. However, the Hebrew word \"Perushim\" from which \"Pharisee\" is derived, actually means \"separatists\", referencing their focus on spiritual needs versus worldly pleasures. In the Gospels, Jesus is often shown as being critical of Pharisees. Not all Pharisees, nor all Jews of that time, were legalistic. Though modern language has used the word Pharisee in the pejorative to describe someone who is legalistic and rigid, it is not an accurate description of all Pharisees. The argument over the \"Spirit of the Law\" vs. the \"Letter of the Law\" was part of early Jewish dialogue as well. [ 3 ] The Parable of the Good Samaritan ( Luke 10:25–37 ) is one of the New Testament texts to address this theme. The passage concerns a dialogue between Jesus and an \"expert in the law\" or \"lawyer\". As described in verse 25 (\"a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him saying, Teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life?,\" NKJV), the intent of the dialogue was to trap Jesus into making statements contrary to the law. Jesus responds by posing the question back to the lawyer, as already having knowledge of the law, (\"What is written in the law?\" verse 26) The lawyer quotes Deuteronomy 6:5 \"You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind and your neighbor as yourself.\", NKJV) and Leviticus 19:18 . The question \"Who is my neighbor?\", that follows in verse 29, is described as being asked with the goal of self-justification. It is then that Jesus responds with the story of a man beaten by robbers who is ignored by a Priest and a Levite, but then rescued and compassionately cared for by a Samaritan. Priests and Levites were Israelites whose qualifications and duties were very meticulously set forth in Mosaic law, (Leviticus 10, and Numbers 5-8) while Samaritans were descended from Israelites who had intermarried with their Babylonian captives and established a sect with an alternative interpretation of the Law. In the story, both the Priest and Levite follow their prescribed regulations dutifully, yet do not help the injured traveler, even crossing to the other side of the road to avoid possible rule violations. The Samaritan, whose very existence is based on a rejection of Jewish law, (specifically those post-Pentateuchal biblical books that identify Mount Moriah as the proper place of worship specified in Deuteronomy 12; the Samaritans considered only the Pentateuch canon, and worshipped Yahweh in their temple on Mount Gerizim) goes above and beyond simply tending to the injured man. He takes him to an inn and gives money for the man's care, promises and then actually does return to inquire about the man, and pay any overage incurred. Jesus concludes by asking the lawyer which of the men was a \"neighbor\" to the beaten traveller, to which the reply was \"the one who showed compassion\". [ 4 ] Then Jesus says to him \"go and do likewise\". According to Jeremiah, \"the qualities of the new covenant expounded upon the old are: a) It will not be broken; b) Its law will be written in the heart, not merely on tablets of stone; c) The knowledge of God will deem it no longer necessary to put it into written words of instruction.\" [ 5 ] According to Luke ( Luke 22:20 ), and Paul, in the first epistle to the Corinthians ( 1 Corinthians 11:25 ), this prophecy was fulfilled only through the work of Jesus Christ , [ 5 ] who said \"This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which will be shed for you.\" Christ did not come to abolish the law but to fulfill it. His purpose was to encourage people to look beyond the \"letter of the law\" to the \"spirit of the law\"...the principles behind the commandments and the law's intention. Gaming the system [ edit ] See also: Legal loophole Gaming the system can be defined as using the rules and procedures meant to protect a system to, instead, manipulate the system for a desired outcome. [ 6 ] The first known documented use of the term \"gaming the system\" is in 1975. [ 7 ] According to James Rieley, a British advisor to CEOs and an author, structures in companies and organizations (both explicit and implicit policies and procedures, stated goals, and mental models) drive behaviors that are detrimental to long-term organizational success and stifle competition. [ 8 ] For some, error is the essence of gaming the system, in which a gap in protocol allows for errant practices that lead to unintended results. [ 9 ] Although the term generally carries negative connotations, gaming the system can be used for benign purposes in the undermining and dismantling of corrupt or oppressive organisations. [ 10 ] Modern usage [ edit ] During the COVID-19 pandemic , Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged Singaporeans to comply not just with the letter of the Circuit Breaker rules but the spirit behind why he wanted these rules to be implemented.

These are mathematical tools used to estimate the strength of the semantic relationship between units of language, concepts or instances, through a numerical description obtained according to the comparison of information supporting their meaning or describing their nature. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The term semantic similarity is often confused with semantic relatedness. Semantic relatedness includes any relation between two terms, while semantic similarity only includes \"is a\" relations. [ 3 ] For example, \"car\" is similar to \"bus\", but is also related to \"road\" and \"driving\". Computationally, semantic similarity can be estimated by defining a topological similarity, by using ontologies to define the distance between terms/concepts. For example, a naive metric for the comparison of concepts ordered in a partially ordered set and represented as nodes of a directed acyclic graph (e.g., a taxonomy ), would be the shortest-path linking the two concept nodes. Based on text analyses, semantic relatedness between units of language (e.g., words, sentences) can also be estimated using statistical means such as a vector space model to correlate words and textual contexts from a suitable text corpus . The evaluation of the proposed semantic similarity / relatedness measures are evaluated through two main ways. The former is based on the use of datasets designed by experts and composed of word pairs with semantic similarity / relatedness degree estimation. The second way is based on the integration of the measures inside specific applications such as information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing, etc. Terminology [ edit ] The concept of semantic similarity is more specific than semantic relatedness , as the latter includes concepts as antonymy and meronymy , while similarity does not. [ 4 ] However, much of the literature uses these terms interchangeably, along with terms like semantic distance. In essence, semantic similarity, semantic distance, and semantic relatedness all mean, \"How much does term A have to do with term B?\" The answer to this question is usually a number between −1 and 1, or between 0 and 1, where 1 signifies extremely high similarity. Visualization [ edit ] An intuitive way of visualizing the semantic similarity of terms is by grouping together terms which are closely related and spacing wider apart the ones which are distantly related. This is also common in practice for mind maps and concept maps . A more direct way of visualizing the semantic similarity of two linguistic items can be seen with the Semantic Folding approach. In this approach a linguistic item such as a term or a text can be represented by generating a pixel for each of its active semantic features in e.g. a 128 x 128 grid. This allows for a direct visual comparison of the semantics of two items by comparing image representations of their respective feature sets. Applications [ edit ] In biomedical informatics [ edit ] Semantic similarity measures have been applied and developed in biomedical ontologies. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] They are mainly used to compare genes and proteins based on the similarity of their functions [ 7 ] rather than on their sequence similarity , but they are also being extended to other bioentities, such as diseases. [ 8 ] These comparisons can be done using tools freely available on the web: ProteInOn can be used to find interacting proteins, find assigned GO terms and calculate the functional semantic similarity of UniProt proteins and to get the information content and calculate the functional semantic similarity of GO terms. [ 9 ] CMPSim provides a functional similarity measure between chemical compounds and metabolic pathways using ChEBI based semantic similarity measures. [ 10 ] CESSM provides a tool for the automated evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures. [ 11 ] In geoinformatics [ edit ] Similarity is also applied in geoinformatics to find similar geographic features or feature types: [ 12 ] SIM-DL similarity server [ 13 ] can be used to compute similarities between concepts stored in geographic feature type ontologies. Similarity Calculator can be used to compute how well related two geographic concepts are in the Geo-Net-PT ontology. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The OSM [ 16 ] semantic network can be used to compute the semantic similarity of tags in OpenStreetMap . [ 17 ] In computational linguistics [ edit ] Several metrics use WordNet , a manually constructed lexical database of English words. Despite the advantages of having human supervision in constructing the database, since the words are not automatically learned the database cannot measure relatedness between multi-word term, non-incremental vocabulary. [ 4 ] [ 18 ] In natural language processing [ edit ] Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science and linguistics. Sentiment analysis, Natural language understanding and Machine translation (Automatically translate text from one human language to another) are a few of the major areas where it is being used. For example, knowing one information resource in the internet, it is often of immediate interest to find similar resources. The Semantic Web provides semantic extensions to find similar data by content and not just by arbitrary descriptors. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Deep learning methods have become an accurate way to gauge semantic similarity between two text passages, in which each passage is first embedded into a continuous vector representation. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In ontology matching [ edit ] Semantic similarity plays a crucial role in ontology alignment , which aims to establish correspondences between entities from different ontologies. It involves quantifying the degree of similarity between concepts or terms using the information present in the ontology for each entity, such as labels, descriptions, and hierarchical relations to other entities. Traditional metrics used in ontology matching are based on a lexical similarity between features of the entities, such as using the Levenshtein distance to measure the edit distance between entity labels. [ 31 ] However, it is difficult to capture the semantic similarity between entities using these metrics. For example, when comparing two ontologies describing conferences, the entities \"Contribution\" and \"Paper\" may have high semantic similarity since they share the same meaning. Nonetheless, due to their lexical differences, lexicographical similarity alone cannot establish this alignment. To capture these semantic similarities, embeddings are being adopted in ontology matching. [ 32 ] By encoding semantic relationships and contextual information, embeddings enable the calculation of similarity scores between entities based on the proximity of their vector representations in the embedding space. This approach allows for efficient and accurate matching of ontologies since embeddings can model semantic differences in entity naming, such as homonymy, by assigning different embeddings to the same word based on different contexts. [ 32 ] Measures [ edit ] Topological similarity [ edit ] There are essentially two types of approaches that calculate topological similarity between ontological concepts: Edge-based: which use the edges and their types as the data source; Node-based: in which the main data sources are the nodes and their properties. Other measures calculate the similarity between ontological instances: Pairwise: measure functional similarity between two instances by combining the semantic similarities of the concepts they represent Groupwise: calculate the similarity directly not combining the semantic similarities of the concepts they represent Some examples: Edge-based [ edit ] Pekar et al. [ 33 ] Cheng and Cline [ 34 ] Wu et al. [ 35 ] Del Pozo et al. [ 36 ] IntelliGO: Benabderrahmane et al. [ 6 ] Node-based [ edit ] Resnik [ 37 ] based on the notion of information content . The information content of a concept (term or word) is the logarithm of the probability of finding the concept in a given corpus. only considers the information content of lowest common subsumer (lcs). A lowest common subsumer is a concept in a lexical taxonomy (e.g. WordNet), which has the shortest distance from the two concepts compared. For example, animal and mammal both are the subsumers of cat and dog, but mammal is lower subsumer than animal for them. Lin [ 38 ] based on Resnik's similarity. considers the information content of lowest common subsumer (lcs) and the two compared concepts. Maguitman, Menczer , Roinestad and Vespignani [ 39 ] Generalizes Lin's similarity to arbitrary ontologies (graphs). Jiang and Conrath [ 40 ] based on Resnik's similarity. considers the information content of lowest common subsumer (lcs) and the two compared concepts to calculate the distance between the two concepts. The distance is later used in computing the similarity measure. Align, Disambiguate, and Walk : Random walks on Semantic Networks [ 41 ] Node-and-relation-content-based [ edit ] applicable to ontology consider properties (content) of nodes consider types (content) of relations based on eTVSM [ 42 ] based on Resnik's similarity [ 43 ] Pairwise [ edit ] maximum of the pairwise similarities composite average in which only the best-matching pairs are considered (best-match average) Groupwise [ edit ] Jaccard index Statistical similarity [ edit ] Statistical similarity approaches can be learned from data, or predefined. Similarity learning can often outperform predefined similarity measures. Broadly speaking, these approaches build a statistical model of documents, and use it to estimate similarity. LSA ( latent semantic analysis ): [ 44 ] [ 45 ] (+) vector-based, adds vectors to measure multi-word terms; (−) non-incremental vocabulary, long pre-processing times PMI ( pointwise mutual information ): (+) large vocab, because it uses any search engine (like Google); (−) cannot measure relatedness between whole sentences or documents SOC-PMI ( second-order co-occurrence pointwise mutual information ): (+) sort lists of important neighbor words from a large corpus; (−) cannot measure relatedness between whole sentences or documents GLSA (generalized latent semantic analysis): (+) vector-based, adds vectors to measure multi-word terms; (−) non-incremental vocabulary, long pre-processing times ICAN (incremental construction of an associative network): (+) incremental, network-based measure, good for spreading activation, accounts for second-order relatedness; (−) cannot measure relatedness between multi-word terms, long pre-processing times NGD ( normalized Google distance ): (+) large vocab, because it uses any search engine (like Google); (−) can measure relatedness between whole sentences or documents but the larger the sentence or document, the more ingenuity is required (Cilibrasi & Vitanyi, 2007). [ 46 ] TSS (Twitter semantic similarity): [ 47 ] large vocab, because it use online tweets from Twitter to compute the similarity. It has high temporary resolution that allows to capture high frequency events. Open source NCD ( normalized compression distance ) ESA ( explicit semantic analysis ) based on Wikipedia and the ODP SSA (salient semantic analysis) [ 48 ] which indexes terms using salient concepts found in their immediate context. n° of Wikipedia (noW), [ 49 ] inspired by the game Six Degrees of Wikipedia, [ 50 ] is a distance metric based on the hierarchical structure of Wikipedia. A directed-acyclic graph is first constructed and later, Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is employed to determine the noW value between two terms as the geodesic distance between the corresponding topics (i.e. nodes) in the graph. VGEM (vector generation of an explicitly defined multidimensional semantic space): [ 51 ] (+) incremental vocab, can compare multi-word terms (−) performance depends on choosing specific dimensions SimRank NASARI: [ 52 ] Sparse vector representations constructed by applying the hypergeometric distribution over the Wikipedia corpus in combination with BabelNet taxonomy. Cross-lingual similarity is currently also possible thanks to the multilingual and unified extension. [ 53 ] Semantics-based similarity [ edit ] Marker passing: Combining lexical decomposition for automated ontology creation and marker passing, the approach of Fähndrich et al. introduces a new type of semantic similarity measure. [ 54 ] Here markers are passed from the two target concepts carrying an amount of activation. This activation might increase or decrease depending on the relations weight with which the concepts are connected. This combines edge and node based approaches and includes connectionist reasoning with symbolic information. Good common subsumer (GCS)-based semantic similarity measure [ 55 ] Semantics similarity networks [ edit ] A semantic similarity network (SSN) is a special form of semantic network . designed to represent concepts and their semantic similarity. Its main contribution is reducing the complexity of calculating semantic distances. Bendeck (2004, 2008) introduced the concept of semantic similarity networks (SSN) as the specialization of a semantic network to measure semantic similarity from ontological representations. [ 56 ] Implementations include genetic information handling. Gold standards [ edit ] Researchers have collected datasets with similarity judgements on pairs of words, which are used to evaluate the cognitive plausibility of computational measures. The golden standard up to today is an old 65 word list where humans have judged the word similarity.

The account 34.68.0.0/16 has been blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s): Why you are seeing this message: Your current IP address is blocked from editing Wikipedia because it appears to belong to a VPN or proxy service . These types of services are commonly used for abusive editing and circumventing Wikipedia policies, so Wikipedia blocks them as a preventive measure — even if you personally haven't done anything wrong. How to fix it: Turn off VPNs, proxies, or tools like iCloud Private Relay (for Apple users) or Microsoft Edge Secure Network . This is the most frequent reason users encounter this block. Try a different connection. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or use a home network instead of a public or work one. Whitelist Wikipedia.

It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November 2015. [ 2 ] Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process, for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers. [ 3 ] The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing , machine learning , human–computer interaction , and information retrieval . [ 4 ] Semantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science , geoscience , and neuroscience . [ 5 ] In 2017, the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus. [ 5 ] As of September 2022 [update] , it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science. [ 6 ] Technology [ edit ] Semantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary of scientific literature . One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices. [ 7 ] It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read. [ 8 ] Artificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper, generating it through an \"abstractive\" technique. [ 3 ] The project uses a combination of machine learning , natural language processing , and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis , and to extract relevant figures, tables , entities, and venues from papers. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Another key AI-powered feature is Research Feeds, an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date. It uses a state-of-the-art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder. [ 11 ] Semantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader, an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual. [ 12 ] Semantic Reader provides in-line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR (short for Too Long, Didn't Read) automatically generated short summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster. In contrast with Google Scholar and PubMed , Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper. [ 13 ] The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics. [ 14 ] Like the previously cited search engines, Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures, which include the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph , Springer Nature's SciGraph , and the Semantic Scholar Corpus (originally a 45 million papers corpus in computer science, neuroscience and biomedicine). [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Article identifier [ edit ] Each paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID (abbreviated S2CID). The following entry is an example: Liu, Ying; Gayle, Albert A; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Rocklöv, Joacim (March 2020). \"The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus\". Journal of Travel Medicine . 27 (2). doi : 10.1093/jtm/taaa021 . PMID 32052846 . S2CID 211099356 . Indexing [ edit ] Semantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines (i.e. Google Scholar ) does not search for material that is behind a paywall . [ 5 ] [ better source needed ] One study compared the index scope of Semantic Scholar to Google Scholar, and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science, the two indices had comparable coverage, each only missing a handful of the papers. [ 17 ] Number of users and publications [ edit ] As of January 2018, following a 2017 project that added Arrington's papers and topic summaries, the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from computer science and biomedicine . [ 18 ] In March 2018, Doug Raymond, who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform, was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project. [ 19 ] As of August 2019 [update] , the number of included papers metadata (not the actual PDFs) had grown to more than 173 million [ 20 ] after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records. [ 21 ] In 2020, a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the University of Chicago Press Journals made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus. [ 22 ] At the end of 2020, Semantic Scholar had indexed 190 million papers. [ 23 ] In 2020, Semantic Scholar reached seven million users per month.

[ 1 ] SEM may incorporate search engine optimization (SEO), which adjusts or rewrites website content and site architecture to achieve a higher ranking in search engine results pages to enhance pay-per-click (PPC) listings and increase the call to action (CTA) on the website. [ 2 ] Market In 2007, U.S. advertisers spent US $24.6 billion on search engine marketing. [ 3 ] In Q2 2015, Google (73.7%) and the Yahoo/Bing (26.3%) partnership accounted for almost 100% of U.S. search engine spend. [ 4 ] As of 2006, SEM was growing much faster than traditional advertising and even other channels of online marketing. [ 5 ] Managing search campaigns is either done directly with the SEM vendor or through an SEM tool provider. It may also be self-serve or through an advertising agency. Search engine marketing is also a method of business analytics, which is mainly aimed at providing useful information for organizations to find business opportunities and generate profits. SEM can help organizations optimize their marketing and gather more audience and create more customers. [ 6 ] Google's market dominance As of October 2016, Google leads the global search engine market with a market share of 89.3%. Bing comes second with a market share of 4.36%, Yahoo comes third with a market share of 3.3%, and Chinese search engine Baidu is fourth globally with a share of about 0.68%. [ 7 ] In August 2024, Google's search engine was declared by a court to be a monopoly over the market. [ 8 ] During the trial, the US Department of Justice argued \"Google hasn’t just illegally cornered the market in search — it’s squeezed online publishers and advertisers with a “trifecta” of monopolies that have harmed virtually the entire World Wide Web\" [ 9 ] History As the number of sites on the Web increased in the mid-to-late 1990s, search engines started appearing to help people find information quickly. Search engines developed business models to finance their services, such as pay per click programs offered by Open Text [ 10 ] in 1996 and then Goto.com [ 11 ] in 1998. Goto.com later changed its name [ 12 ] to Overture in 2001, was purchased by Yahoo! in 2003, and now offers paid search opportunities for advertisers through Yahoo! Search Marketing. Google also began to offer advertisements on search results pages in 2000 through the Google AdWords program. By 2007, pay-per-click programs proved to be primary moneymakers [ 13 ] for search engines. In a market dominated by Google, in 2009 Yahoo! and Microsoft announced the intention to forge an alliance. The Yahoo! & Microsoft Search Alliance eventually received approval from regulators in the US and Europe in February 2010. [ 14 ] Search engine optimization consultants expanded their offerings to help businesses learn about and use the advertising opportunities offered by search engines, and new agencies focusing primarily upon marketing and advertising through search engines emerged. The term \"search engine marketing\" was popularized by Danny Sullivan in 2001 [ 15 ] to cover the spectrum of activities involved in performing SEO, managing paid listings at the search engines, submitting sites to directories, and developing online marketing strategies for businesses, organizations, and individuals. Methods and metrics Search engine marketing uses at least five methods and metrics to optimize websites. [ 16 ] Keyword research and analysis involve three \"steps\": ensuring the site can be indexed in the search engines, finding the most relevant and popular keywords for the site and its products, and using those keywords on the site in a way that will generate and convert traffic. A follow-on effect of keyword analysis and research is the search perception impact. Search perception impact describes the identified impact of a brand's search results on consumer perception, including title and meta tags, site indexing, and keyword focus. As online searching is often the first step for potential consumers/customers, the search perception impact shapes the brand impression for each individual. Website saturation and popularity, or how much presence a website has on search engines, can be analyzed through the number of pages of the site that are indexed by search engines (saturation) and how many backlinks the site has (popularity). It requires pages to contain keywords people are looking for and ensure that they rank high enough in search engine rankings. Most search engines include some form of link popularity in their ranking algorithms. The following are major tools measuring various aspects of saturation and link popularity: Link Popularity, Top 10 Google Analysis, and Marketleap's Link Popularity and Search Engine Saturation. Back end tools, including Web analytic tools and HTML validators, provide data on a website and its visitors and allow the success of a website to be measured. They range from simple traffic counters to tools that work with log files and to more sophisticated tools that are based on page tagging (putting JavaScript or an image on a page to track actions). These tools can deliver conversion-related information. Validators check the invisible parts of websites, highlighting potential problems and many usability issues and ensuring websites meet W3C code standards. Try to use more than one HTML validator or spider simulator because each one tests, highlights, and reports on slightly different aspects of your website. Whois tools reveal the owners of various websites and can provide valuable information relating to copyright and trademark issues. Google Mobile-Friendly Website Checker: This test will analyze a URL and report if the page has a mobile-friendly design. [ 17 ] Search engine marketing is a way to create and edit a website so that search engines rank it higher than other pages. It should be also focused on keyword marketing or pay-per-click advertising (PPC). The technology enables advertisers to bid on specific keywords or phrases and ensures ads appear with the results of search engines. With the development of this system, the price is growing under a high level of competition. Many advertisers prefer to expand their activities, including increasing search engines and adding more keywords. The more advertisers are willing to pay for clicks, the higher the ranking for advertising, which leads to higher traffic. [ 18 ] PPC comes at a cost. The higher position is likely to cost $5 for a given keyword, and $4.50 for a third location. A third advertiser earns 10% less than the top advertiser while reducing traffic by 50%. [ 18 ] Investors must consider their return on investment when engaging in PPC campaigns. Buying traffic via PPC will deliver a positive ROI when the total cost-per-click for a single conversion remains below the profit margin . That way the amount of money spent to generate revenue is below the actual revenue generated. There are many reasons explaining why advertisers choose the SEM strategy. First, creating a SEM account is easy and can build traffic quickly based on the degree of competition. The shopper who uses the search engine to find information tends to trust and focus on the links showed in the results pages. However, a large number of online sellers do not buy search engine optimization to obtain higher ranking lists of search results but prefer paid links. A growing number of online publishers are allowing search engines such as Google to crawl content on their pages and place relevant ads on it. [ 19 ] From an online seller's point of view, this is an extension of the payment settlement and an additional incentive to invest in paid advertising projects. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for advertisers with limited budgets to maintain the highest rankings in the increasingly competitive search market. Google's search engine marketing is one of the western world's marketing leaders, while its search engine marketing is its biggest source of profit. [ 20 ] Google's search engine providers are clearly ahead of the Yahoo and Bing network. The display of unknown search results is free, while advertisers are willing to pay for each click of the ad in the sponsored search results. Paid inclusion Paid inclusion involves a search engine company charging fees for the inclusion of a website in their results pages. Also known as sponsored listings, paid inclusion products are provided by most search engine companies either in the main results area or as a separately identified advertising area. The fee structure is both a filter against superfluous submissions and a revenue generator. Typically, the fee covers an annual subscription for one webpage, which will automatically be catalogued on a regular basis. However, some companies are experimenting with non-subscription based fee structures where purchased listings are displayed permanently. A per-click fee may also apply. Each search engine is different. Some sites allow only paid inclusion, although these have had little success. More frequently, many search engines, like Yahoo! , [ 21 ] mix paid inclusion (per-page and per-click fee) with results from web crawling. Others, like Google (and as of 2006, Ask.com [ 22 ] [ 23 ] ), do not let webmasters pay to be in their search engine listing (advertisements are shown separately and labeled as such). Some detractors of paid inclusion allege that it causes searches to return results based more on the economic standing of the interests of a web site, and less on the relevancy of that site to end-users . Often the line between pay per click advertising and paid inclusion is debatable. Some have lobbied for any paid listings to be labeled as an advertisement, while defenders insist they are not actually ads since the webmasters do not control the content of the listing, its ranking, or even whether it is shown to any users. Another advantage of paid inclusion is that it allows site owners to specify particular schedules for crawling pages. In the general case, one has no control as to when their page will be crawled or added to a search engine index. Paid inclusion proves to be particularly useful for cases where pages are dynamically generated and frequently modified. Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing method in itself, but also a tool of search engine optimization since experts and firms can test out different approaches to improving ranking and see the results often within a couple of days, instead of waiting weeks or months. Knowledge gained this way can be used to optimize other web pages, without paying the search engine company. Comparison with SEO SEM is the wider discipline that incorporates SEO . SEM includes both paid search results (using tools like Google AdWords or Bing Ads, formerly known as Microsoft adCenter) and organic search results (SEO). SEM uses paid advertising with AdWords or Bing Ads , pay per click (particularly beneficial for local providers as it enables potential consumers to contact a company directly with one click), article submissions, advertising and making sure SEO has been done. A keyword analysis is performed for both SEO and SEM, but not necessarily at the same time. SEM and SEO both need to be monitored and updated frequently to reflect evolving best practices. In some contexts, the term SEM is used exclusively to mean pay per click advertising , [ 2 ] particularly in the commercial advertising and marketing communities which have a vested interest in this narrow definition. Such usage excludes the wider search marketing community that is engaged in other forms of SEM such as search engine optimization and search retargeting . Creating the link between SEO and PPC represents an integral part of the SEM concept. Sometimes, especially when separate teams work on SEO and PPC and the efforts are not synced, positive results of aligning their strategies can be lost. The aim of both SEO and PPC is maximizing the visibility in search and thus, their actions to achieve it should be centrally coordinated. Both teams can benefit from setting shared goals and combined metrics, evaluating data together to determine future strategy or discuss which of the tools works better to get the traffic for selected keywords in the national and local search results. Thanks to this, the search visibility can be increased along with optimizing both conversions and costs. [ 24 ] Another part of SEM is social media marketing (SMM). SMM is a type of marketing that involves exploiting social media to influence consumers that one company’s products and/or services are valuable. [ 25 ] Some of the latest theoretical advances include search engine marketing management (SEMM). SEMM relates to activities including SEO but focuses on return on investment (ROI) management instead of relevant traffic building (as is the case of mainstream SEO). SEMM also integrates organic SEO, trying to achieve top ranking without using paid means to achieve it, and pay per click SEO. For example, some of the attention is placed on the web page layout design and how content and information is displayed to the website visitor. SEO & SEM are two pillars of one marketing job and they both run side by side to produce much better results than focusing on only one pillar. Ethical questions Further information: Cyberethics Paid search advertising has not been without controversy and the issue of how search engines present advertising on their search result pages has been the target of a series of studies and reports [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] by Consumer Reports WebWatch. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also issued a letter [ 29 ] in 2002 about the importance of disclosure of paid advertising on search engines, in response to a complaint from Commercial Alert, a consumer advocacy group with ties to Ralph Nader . Another ethical controversy associated with search marketing has been the issue of trademark infringement . The debate as to whether third parties should have the right to bid on their competitors' brand names has been underway for years. In 2009 Google changed their policy, which formerly prohibited these tactics, allowing 3rd parties to bid on branded terms as long as their landing page in fact provides information on the trademarked term. [ 30 ] Though the policy has been changed this continues to be a source of heated debate. [ 31 ] On April 24, 2012, many started to see that Google has started to penalize companies that are buying links for the purpose of passing off the rank. The Google Update was called Penguin . Since then, there have been several different Penguin/Panda updates rolled out by Google. SEM has, however, nothing to do with link buying and focuses on organic SEO and PPC management. As of October 20, 2014, Google had released three official revisions of their Penguin Update. In 2013, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Lens.com, Inc. v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc. that online contact lens seller Lens.com did not commit trademark infringement when it purchased search advertisements using competitor 1-800 Contacts ' federally registered 1800 CONTACTS trademark as a keyword. In August 2016, the Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against 1-800 Contacts alleging, among other things, that its trademark enforcement practices in the search engine marketing space have unreasonably restrained competition in violation of the FTC Act. 1-800 Contacts has denied all wrongdoing and appeared before an FTC administrative law judge in April 2017. [ 32 ] Examples Google Ads is recognized as a web-based advertising utensil since it adopts keywords that can deliver adverts explicitly to web users looking for information in respect to a certain product or service. It is flexible and provides customizable options like Ad Extensions, access to non-search sites, leveraging the display network to help increase brand awareness . The project hinges on cost per click (CPC) pricing where the maximum cost per day for the campaign can be chosen, thus the payment of the service only applies if the advert has been clicked. SEM companies have embarked on Google Ads projects as a way to publicize their SEM and SEO services. One of the most successful approaches to the strategy of this project was to focus on making sure that PPC advertising funds were prudently invested. Moreover, SEM companies have described Google Ads as a practical tool for increasing a consumer’s investment earnings on Internet advertising. The use of conversion tracking and Google Analytics tools was deemed to be practical for presenting to clients the performance of their canvas from click to conversion. Google Ads project has enabled SEM companies to train their clients on the utensil and delivers better performance to the canvass. The assistance of Google Ads canvass could contribute to the growth of web traffic for a number of its consumer’s websites, by as much as 250% in only nine months. [ 33 ] Another way search engine marketing is managed is by contextual advertising . Here marketers place ads on other sites or portals that carry information relevant to their products so that the ads jump into the circle of vision of browsers who are seeking information from those sites. A successful SEM plan is the approach to capture the relationships amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines. Search engines were not important to some industries in the past, but over the past years the use of search engines for accessing information has become vital to increase business opportunities. [ 34 ] The use of SEM strategic tools for businesses such as tourism can attract potential consumers to view their products, but it could also pose various challenges. [ 35 ] These challenges could be the competition that companies face amongst their industry and other sources of information that could draw the attention of online consumers. [ 34 ] To assist the combat of challenges, the main objective for businesses applying SEM is to improve and maintain their ranking as high as possible on SERPs so that they can gain visibility. Therefore, search engines are adjusting and developing algorithms and the shifting criteria by which web pages are ranked sequentially to combat against search engine misuse and spamming, and to supply the most relevant information to searchers. [ 34 ] This could enhance the relationship amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines by understanding the strategies of marketing to attract business.

Find sources: \"CLEVER project\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( September 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The CLEVER project was a research project in Web search led by Jon Kleinberg at IBM 's Almaden Research Center . Techniques developed in CLEVER included various forms of link analysis , including the HITS algorithm . Features [ edit ] The CLEVER search engine incorporates several algorithms that make use of the Web 's hyperlink structure for discovering high-quality information. It can be exceedingly difficult to locate resources on the World Wide Web that are both high-quality and relevant to a user's informational needs. Traditional automated search methods for locating information on the Web are easily overwhelmed by low-quality and unrelated content. Second generation search engines have to have effective methods for focusing on the most authoritative documents. The rich structure implicit in hyperlinks among Web documents offers a simple, and effective, means to deal with many of these problems. Members of the Clever project have come up with a mathematical algorithm that views the Net as simply web pages pointing at each other. It also takes into account the notion of hubs, which point to quality content and link information together, and the idea of authority pages, which are often written by specialists in certain fields. Bill Cody, senior manager of exploratory data management research at IBM's Almaden Research Center , said: \"Web searches provide a lot of information, some good, some bad. But the people providing good hubs usually point to authority pages and authority pages generally know of good hubs. The algorithm enables us to find them and so provide users with quality information rather than the regular list of irrelevant web pages.\" He added that the algorithm had also been used to find Internet based communities using the same principle of finding links between like and like. It was used to discover 300,000 communities worldwide, only four per cent of which turned out to be spurious. About two thirds of these still existed, he claimed, with about half now appearing on Yahoo as mature communities. Cody said that the tool could be used for targeted advertising purposes or for enabling users to find out more information about incipient communities, but declined to say whether IBM had plans to turn Clever into a commercial product or not.

For other uses, see Neuron (disambiguation) . Not to be confused with Neutron . Neuron Anatomy of a multipolar neuron Identifiers MeSH D009474 NeuroLex ID sao1417703748 TA98 A14.0.00.002 TH H2.00.06.1.00002 FMA 54527 Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy [ edit on Wikidata ] A neuron ( American English ), neurone ( British English ), [ 1 ] or nerve cell , is an excitable cell that fires electric signals called action potentials across a neural network in the nervous system . They are located in the nervous system and help to receive and conduct impulses. Neurons communicate with other cells via synapses , which are specialized connections that commonly use minute amounts of chemical neurotransmitters to pass the electric signal from the presynaptic neuron to the target cell through the synaptic gap. Neurons are the main components of nervous tissue in all animals except sponges and placozoans . Plants and fungi do not have nerve cells. Molecular evidence suggests that the ability to generate electric signals first appeared in evolution some 700 to 800 million years ago, during the Tonian period. Predecessors of neurons were the peptidergic secretory cells. They eventually gained new gene modules which enabled cells to create post-synaptic scaffolds and ion channels that generate fast electrical signals. The ability to generate electric signals was a key innovation in the evolution of the nervous system. [ 2 ] Neurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. Sensory neurons respond to stimuli such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the sensory organs , and they send signals to the spinal cord and then to the sensorial area in the brain . Motor neurons receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from muscle contractions [ 3 ] to glandular output . Interneurons connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. When multiple neurons are functionally connected together, they form what is called a neural circuit . A neuron contains all the structures of other cells such as a nucleus , mitochondria , and Golgi bodies but has additional unique structures such as an axon , and dendrites . [ 4 ] The soma or cell body, is a compact structure, and the axon and dendrites are filaments extruding from the soma. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the axon hillock and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are axon terminals , where the neuron can transmit a signal across the synapse to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axons. The term neurite is used to describe either a dendrite or an axon, particularly when the cell is undifferentiated . Most neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite. The signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to the maintenance of voltage gradients across their membranes . If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an all-or-nothing electrochemical pulse called an action potential . This potential travels rapidly along the axon and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be excitatory or inhibitory , increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma. In most cases, neurons are generated by neural stem cells during brain development and childhood. Neurogenesis largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain. Nervous system [ edit ] Neurons are the primary components of the nervous system , along with the glial cells that give them structural and metabolic support. [ 5 ] The nervous system is made up of the central nervous system , which includes the brain and spinal cord , and the peripheral nervous system , which includes the autonomic , enteric and somatic nervous systems . [ 6 ] In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the central nervous system , but some reside in peripheral ganglia , and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the retina and cochlea . Axons may bundle into nerve fascicles that make up the nerves in the peripheral nervous system (like strands of wire that make up a cable). In the central nervous system bundles of axons are called nerve tracts . Anatomy and histology [ edit ] Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron Schematic of a single pyramidal neuron , with a synapse from an incoming axon onto a dendritic spine Neurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given the diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 micrometers in diameter. [ 7 ] The soma is the body of the neuron. As it contains the nucleus , most protein synthesis occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter. [ 8 ] The dendrites of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure are referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. The branches form fractal patterns that repeat at multiple size scales. [ 9 ] This fractal tree is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the dendritic spine . The axon is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries nerve signals away from the soma and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock . Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels . This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative threshold potential . While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons. The axon terminal is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains synapses . Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where neurotransmitter chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have en passant boutons , which are located along the length of the axon. The accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function. [ 10 ] Axons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10–25 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human motor neuron can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes. Sensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the posterior column of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. Giraffes have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the squid giant axon , an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5–1 millimeter thick, several centimeters long). Fully differentiated neurons are permanently postmitotic [ 11 ] however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see neurogenesis ). Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of pluripotency . [ 12 ] Membrane [ edit ] Like all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane , a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of embedded protein structures. [ 13 ] A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator , but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are gated , permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated , meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The ions include sodium , potassium , chloride , and calcium . The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a little less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machineries that are embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane. Histology and internal structure [ edit ] Golgi-stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue Actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture Numerous microscopic clumps called Nissl bodies (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye. These structures consist of rough endoplasmic reticulum and associated ribosomal RNA . Named after German psychiatrist and neuropathologist Franz Nissl (1860–1919), they are involved in protein synthesis and their prominence can be explained by the fact that nerve cells are very metabolically active. Basophilic dyes such as aniline or (weakly) hematoxylin [ 14 ] highlight negatively charged components, and so bind to the phosphate backbone of the ribosomal RNA. The cell body of a neuron is supported by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments , which together with neurotubules (neuronal microtubules) are assembled into larger neurofibrils. [ 15 ] Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines ), and lipofuscin (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules . Class III β-tubulin is found almost exclusively in neurons. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development. There the actin dynamics can be modulated via an interplay with microtubule. [ 19 ] There are different internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons seldom contain ribosomes , except some in the initial segment. Dendrites contain granular endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as the distance from the cell body increases. Classification [ edit ] Image of pyramidal neurons in mouse cerebral cortex expressing green fluorescent protein . The red staining indicates GABAergic interneurons. [ 20 ] See also: List of distinct cell types in the adult human body § Nervous system Neurons vary in shape and size and can be classified by their morphology and function. [ 21 ] The anatomist Camillo Golgi grouped neurons into two types; type I with long axons used to move signals over long distances and type II with short axons, which can often be confused with dendrites. Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal motor neurons , consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a myelin sheath . The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching axon terminals that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. [ citation needed ] Structural classification [ edit ] Polarity [ edit ] Different kinds of neurons Most neurons can be anatomically characterized as: [ 4 ] Unipolar : single process. Unipolar cells are exclusively sensory neurons. Their dendrites receive sensory information, sometimes directly from the stimulus itself. The cell bodies of unipolar neurons are always found in ganglia. Sensory reception is a peripheral function, so the cell body is in the periphery, though closer to the CNS in a ganglion. The axon projects from the dendrite endings, past the cell body in a ganglion, and into the central nervous system. Bipolar : 1 axon and 1 dendrite. They are found mainly in the olfactory epithelium , and as part of the retina. Multipolar : 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites Golgi I : neurons with long-projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells Golgi II : neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell Anaxonic : where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s) Pseudounipolar : 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite Other [ edit ] Some unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are: [ citation needed ] Basket cells , interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum Betz cells , large motor neurons in primary motor cortex Lugaro cells , interneurons of the cerebellum Medium spiny neurons , most neurons in the corpus striatum Purkinje cells , huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron Pyramidal cells , neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I Rosehip cells , unique human inhibitory neurons that interconnect with Pyramidal cells Renshaw cells , neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons Unipolar brush cells , interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft Granule cells , a type of Golgi II neuron Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord Spindle cells , interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain Functional classification [ edit ] Direction [ edit ] Afferent neurons convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called sensory neurons . Efferent neurons (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells. Interneurons connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system. Afferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain. Action on other neurons [ edit ] A neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors . The effect on the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. Receptors are classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in firing rate), inhibitory (causing a decrease in firing rate), or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate). [ citation needed ] The two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, glutamate and GABA , have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors and has effects that are excitatory at ionotropic receptors and a modulatory effect at metabotropic receptors . Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as \"excitatory neurons\", and cells that release GABA as \"inhibitory neurons\". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, \"excitatory\" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release acetylcholine , and \"inhibitory\" spinal neurons that release glycine . [ citation needed ] The distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors. [ 22 ] When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them. [ citation needed ] It is possible to identify the type of inhibitory effect a presynaptic neuron will have on a postsynaptic neuron, based on the proteins the presynaptic neuron expresses. Parvalbumin -expressing neurons typically dampen the output signal of the postsynaptic neuron in the visual cortex , whereas somatostatin -expressing neurons typically block dendritic inputs to the postsynaptic neuron. [ 23 ] Discharge patterns [ edit ] Neurons have intrinsic electroresponsive properties like intrinsic transmembrane voltage oscillatory patterns. [ 24 ] So neurons can be classified according to their electrophysiological characteristics: Tonic or regular spiking. Some neurons are typically constantly (tonically) active, typically firing at a constant frequency. Example: interneurons in neurostriatum . Phasic or bursting . Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic. Fast-spiking. Some neurons are notable for their high firing rates, for example, some types of cortical inhibitory interneurons, cells in globus pallidus , retinal ganglion cells . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Neurotransmitter [ edit ] Synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitters Main article: Neurotransmitter Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers passed from one neuron to another neuron or to a muscle cell or gland cell . Cholinergic neurons – acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a ligand for both ligand-gated ion channels and metabotropic (GPCRs) muscarinic receptors . Nicotinic receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind nicotine . Ligand binding opens the channel causing the influx of Na + depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A . Adrenergic neurons – noradrenaline. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is released from most postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system onto two sets of GPCRs: alpha adrenoceptors and beta adrenoceptors . Noradrenaline is one of the three common catecholamine neurotransmitters, and the most prevalent of them in the peripheral nervous system ; as with other catecholamines, it is synthesized from tyrosine . GABAergic neurons – gamma aminobutyric acid . GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the central nervous system (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to ACh , gating anion channels that allow Cl − ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl − causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase . Glutamatergic neurons – glutamate. Glutamate is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, along with aspartate . Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR). AMPA and Kainate receptors function as cation channels permeable to Na + cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission. NMDA receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to Ca 2+ . The function of NMDA receptors depends on glycine receptor binding as a co- agonist within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present. Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability. Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in brain damage . When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca 2+ and Na + entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme glutamate synthase . Dopaminergic neurons— dopamine . Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra has been linked to Parkinson's disease . Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine . Tyrosine is catalyzed into levodopa (or L-DOPA ) by tyrosine hydroxylase , and levodopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase . Serotonergic neurons— serotonin . Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan by tryptophan hydroxylase , and then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic serotonin transporter are used for treatment, such as Prozac and Zoloft . Purinergic neurons—ATP. ATP is a neurotransmitter acting at both ligand-gated ion channels ( P2X receptors) and GPCRs ( P2Y ) receptors. ATP is, however, best known as a cotransmitter . Such purinergic signaling can also be mediated by other purines like adenosine , which particularly acts at P2Y receptors. Histaminergic neurons— histamine . Histamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter and neuromodulator . Histamine-producing neurons are found in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus . [ 27 ] Histamine is involved in arousal and regulating sleep/wake behaviors. Multimodel classification [ edit ] Since 2012 there has been a push from the cellular and computational neuroscience community to come up with a universal classification of neurons that will apply to all neurons in the brain as well as across species. This is done by considering the three essential qualities of all neurons: electrophysiology, morphology, and the individual transcriptome of the cells. Besides being universal this classification has the advantage of being able to classify astrocytes as well. A method called patch-sequencing in which all three qualities can be measured at once is used extensively by the Allen Institute for Brain Science . [ 28 ] In 2023, a comprehensive cell atlas of the adult, and developing human brain at the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional levels was created through an international collaboration of researchers using the most cutting-edge molecular biology approaches. [ 29 ] Connectivity [ edit ] Main articles: Synapse and Chemical synapse A signal propagating down an axon to the cell body and dendrites of the next cell Chemical synapse Neurons communicate with each other via synapses , where either the axon terminal of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma, or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus , have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses. Synapses can be excitatory or inhibitory, either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron, respectively. Some neurons also communicate via electrical synapses, which are direct, electrically conductive junctions between cells. [ 30 ] When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, it opens voltage-gated calcium channels , allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. Calcium causes synaptic vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules to fuse with the membrane, releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic cleft and activate receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. High cytosolic calcium in the axon terminal triggers mitochondrial calcium uptake, which, in turn, activates mitochondrial energy metabolism to produce ATP to support continuous neurotransmission. [ 31 ] An autapse is a synapse in which a neuron's axon connects to its dendrites. The human brain has some 8.6 x 10 10 (eighty six billion) neurons. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] Each neuron has on average 7,000 synaptic connections to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10 15 synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age , stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10 14 to 5 x 10 14 synapses (100 to 500 trillion). [ 34 ] Nonelectrochemical signaling [ edit ] Beyond electrical and chemical signaling, studies suggest neurons in healthy human brains can also communicate through: force generated by the enlargement of dendritic spines [ 35 ] the transfer of proteins – transneuronally transported proteins (TNTPs) [ 36 ] [ 37 ] They can also get modulated by input from the environment and hormones released from other parts of the organism, [ 38 ] which could be influenced more or less directly by neurons. This also applies to neurotrophins such as BDNF . The gut microbiome is also connected with the brain. [ 39 ] Neurons also communicate with microglia , the brain's main immune cells via specialized contact sites, called \"somatic junctions\". These connections enable microglia to constantly monitor and regulate neuronal functions, and exert neuroprotection when needed. [ 40 ] Mechanisms for propagating action potentials [ edit ] Main article: Action potential In 1937 John Zachary Young suggested that the squid giant axon could be used to study neuronal electrical properties. [ 41 ] It is larger than but similar to human neurons, making it easier to study. By inserting electrodes into the squid giant axons, accurate measurements were made of the membrane potential . The cell membrane of the axon and soma contain voltage-gated ion channels that allow the neuron to generate and propagate an electrical signal (an action potential). Some neurons also generate subthreshold membrane potential oscillations . These signals are generated and propagated by charge-carrying ions including sodium (Na + ), potassium (K + ), chloride (Cl − ), and calcium (Ca 2+ ) . Several stimuli can activate a neuron leading to electrical activity, including pressure , stretch, chemical transmitters, and changes in the electric potential across the cell membrane. [ 42 ] Stimuli cause specific ion-channels within the cell membrane to open, leading to a flow of ions through the cell membrane, changing the membrane potential. Neurons must maintain the specific electrical properties that define their neuron type. [ 43 ] Thin neurons and axons require less metabolic expense to produce and carry action potentials, but thicker axons convey impulses more rapidly. To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of myelin around their axons. The sheaths are formed by glial cells: oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel faster than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1 mm long, punctuated by unsheathed nodes of Ranvier , which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disorder that results from the demyelination of axons in the central nervous system. Some neurons do not generate action potentials but instead generate a graded electrical signal , which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release. Such non-spiking neurons tend to be sensory neurons or interneurons, because they cannot carry signals long distances. Neural coding [ edit ] Neural coding is concerned with how sensory and other information is represented in the brain by neurons. The main goal of studying neural coding is to characterize the relationship between the stimulus and the individual or ensemble neuronal responses and the relationships among the electrical activities of the neurons within the ensemble. [ 44 ] It is thought that neurons can encode both digital and analog information. [ 45 ] All-or-none principle [ edit ] As long as the stimulus reaches the threshold, the full response will be given. A larger stimulus does not result in a larger response, and vice versa. [ 46 ] : 31 Main article: All-or-none law The conduction of nerve impulses is an example of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal but can increase firing frequency. [ 46 ] : 31 Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to a steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased stimulus intensity by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons can not become \"stronger\" for a specific frequency. Other receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with a steady stimulus; examples include skin which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function. The pacinian corpuscle is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, the stimulus ends; thus, these neurons typically respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of several other neurons. [ 47 ] Although Neurons have long been assumed to always give a stereotyped maximal response or none at all, there is a body of research that argues that this is only partially correct, and that while it is true that Neurons either fire an Action Potential or do not, the amplitude and duration of the Action Potentials that a Neuron fires can vary greatly, allowing the Neuron to encode information in at least the strength of the Action Potential. Additionally, the analog information carried in the Action Potential has been shown to be able to survive and travel distances originally not thought to be possible. This has been proposed to be a highly effective way to encode information compared to the usual rate and temporal coding theories commonly seen in the literature, with the ability to transfer around 4 times more information than current wisdom would suggest. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Etymology and spelling [ edit ] The German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer introduced the term neuron in 1891, [ 53 ] based on the ancient Greek νεῦρον neuron 'sinew, cord, nerve'. [ 54 ] The word was adopted in French with the spelling neurone . That spelling was also used by many writers in English, [ 55 ] but has now become rare in American usage and uncommon in British usage. [ 56 ] [ 54 ] Some previous works used nerve cell ( cellule nervose ), as adopted in Camillo Golgi 's 1873 paper on the discovery of the silver staining technique used to visualize nervous tissue under light microscopy. [ 57 ] History [ edit ] Further information: History of neuroscience Drawing by Camillo Golgi of a hippocampus stained using the silver nitrate method Drawing of a Purkinje cell in the cerebellar cortex done by Santiago Ramón y Cajal , demonstrating the ability of Golgi's staining method to reveal fine detail The neuron's place as the primary functional unit of the nervous system was first recognized in the late 19th century through the work of the Spanish anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal . [ 58 ] To make the structure of individual neurons visible, Ramón y Cajal improved a silver staining process that had been developed by Camillo Golgi . [ 58 ] The improved process involves a technique called \"double impregnation\" and is still in use. In 1888 Ramón y Cajal published a paper about the bird cerebellum. In this paper, he stated that he could not find evidence for anastomosis between axons and dendrites and called each nervous element \"an autonomous canton.\" [ 58 ] [ 53 ] This became known as the neuron doctrine , one of the central tenets of modern neuroscience . [ 58 ] In 1891, the German anatomist Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer wrote a highly influential review of the neuron doctrine in which he introduced the term neuron to describe the anatomical and physiological unit of the nervous system. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] The silver impregnation stains are a useful method for neuroanatomical investigations because, for reasons unknown, it stains only a small percentage of cells in a tissue, exposing the complete micro structure of individual neurons without much overlap from other cells. [ 61 ] Neuron doctrine [ edit ] Drawing of neurons in the pigeon cerebellum , by Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal in 1899. (A) denotes Purkinje cells and (B) denotes granule cells , both of which are multipolar. The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units. Later discoveries yielded refinements to the doctrine. For example, glial cells , which are non-neuronal, play an essential role in information processing. [ 62 ] Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought, [ 63 ] comprising direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons; In fact, neurons can form even tighter couplings: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons. [ 64 ] Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body. [ 65 ] The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons [ 66 ] and axons can receive synaptic inputs. [ 67 ] Compartmental modelling of neurons [ edit ] Although neurons are often described as \"fundamental units\" of the brain, they perform internal computations. Neurons integrate input within dendrites, and this complexity is lost in models that assume neurons to be a fundamental unit. Dendritic branches can be modeled as spatial compartments, whose activity is related to passive membrane properties, but may also be different depending on input from synapses. Compartmental modelling of dendrites is especially helpful for understanding the behavior of neurons that are too small to record with electrodes, as is the case for Drosophila melanogaster . [ 68 ] Neurons in the brain [ edit ] The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species. [ 69 ] In a human, there are an estimated 10–20 billion neurons in the cerebral cortex and 55–70 billion neurons in the cerebellum . [ 70 ] By contrast, the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just 302 neurons, making it an ideal model organism as scientists have been able to map all of its neurons. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , a common subject in biological experiments, has around 100,000 neurons and exhibits many complex behaviors. Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.

Find sources: \"Neuron\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( May 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is a heterogeneous inherited disorder of nerves ( neuropathy ) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs extending to the hands and arms in advanced stages. Presently incurable, this disease is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders , affecting 36 in 100,000 people. [ 71 ] Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known simply as Alzheimer's , is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration, together with declining activities of daily living and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. [ 72 ] The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory ( amnesia ), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language ( aphasia ), skilled movements ( apraxia ), and recognition ( agnosia ), and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinson's , is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that often impairs motor skills and speech. [ 75 ] Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders . [ 76 ] It is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor , a slowing of physical movement ( bradykinesia ), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement ( akinesia ). The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor cortex by the basal ganglia , normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high-level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants , cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy . Demyelination [ edit ] Further information: Demyelinating disease Guillain–Barré syndrome – demyelination Demyelination is a process characterized by the gradual loss of the myelin sheath enveloping nerve fibers. When myelin deteriorates, signal conduction along nerves can be significantly impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. Demyelination may affect both central and peripheral nervous systems, contributing to various neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis , Guillain-Barré syndrome , and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy . Although demyelination is often caused by an autoimmune reaction, it may also be caused by viral infections, metabolic disorders, trauma, and some medications. Axonal degeneration [ edit ] Although most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration , which is the rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends, occurring within 30 minutes of injury. [ 77 ] Degeneration follows with swelling of the axolemma , and eventually leads to bead-like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal cytoskeleton and inner organelles occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of mitochondria in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. The endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on ubiquitin and calpain proteases (caused by the influx of calcium ions), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hours in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown. Development [ edit ] Main article: Neurogenesis Neurons develop through the process of neurogenesis , in which neural stem cells divide to produce differentiated neurons . Once fully differentiated they are no longer capable of undergoing mitosis . Neurogenesis primarily occurs during embryonic development . Neurons initially develop from the neural tube in the embryo. The neural tube has three layers – a ventricular zone , an intermediate zone , and a marginal zone. The ventricular zone surrounds the tube's central canal and becomes the ependyma . Dividing cells of the ventricular zone form the intermediate zone which stretches to the outermost layer of the neural tube called the pial layer. The gray matter of the brain is derived from the intermediate zone. The extensions of the neurons in the intermediate zone make up the marginal zone when myelinated becomes the brain's white matter . [ 78 ] Differentiation of the neurons is ordered by their size. Large motor neurons are first. Smaller sensory neurons together with glial cell differentiate at birth . [ 78 ] Adult neurogenesis can occur and studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells and that the vast majority of neurons in the neocortex form before birth and persist without replacement. The extent to which adult neurogenesis exists in humans, and its contribution to cognition are controversial, with conflicting reports published in 2018. [ 79 ] The body contains a variety of stem cell types that can differentiate into neurons. Researchers found a way to transform human skin cells into nerve cells using transdifferentiation , in which \"cells are forced to adopt new identities\". [ 80 ] During neurogenesis in the mammalian brain, progenitor and stem cells progress from proliferative divisions to differentiative divisions. This progression leads to the neurons and glia that populate cortical layers. Epigenetic modifications play a key role in regulating gene expression in differentiating neural stem cells , and are critical for cell fate determination in the developing and adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic modifications include DNA cytosine methylation to form 5-methylcytosine and 5-methylcytosine demethylation . [ 81 ] DNA cytosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) . Methylcytosine demethylation is catalyzed in several stages by TET enzymes that carry out oxidative reactions (e.g. 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ) and enzymes of the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. [ 81 ] At different stages of mammalian nervous system development, two DNA repair processes are employed in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. These pathways are homologous recombinational repair used in proliferating neural precursor cells, and non-homologous end joining used mainly at later developmental stages [ 82 ] Intercellular communication between developing neurons and microglia is also indispensable for proper neurogenesis and brain development.

The algorithm is also known as the Von Mises iteration . [ 1 ] Power iteration is a very simple algorithm, but it may converge slowly. The most time-consuming operation of the algorithm is the multiplication of matrix A {\\displaystyle A} by a vector, so it is effective for a very large sparse matrix with appropriate implementation. The speed of convergence is like ( λ 2 / λ 1 ) k {\\displaystyle (\\lambda _{2}/\\lambda _{1})^{k}} where k {\\displaystyle k} is the number of iterations (see a later section ). In words, convergence is exponential with base being the spectral gap . The method [ edit ] Animation that visualizes the power iteration algorithm on a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is depicted by its two eigenvectors. Error is computed as | | approximation − largest eigenvector | | {\\displaystyle ||{\\text{approximation}}-{\\text{largest eigenvector}}||} The power iteration algorithm starts with a vector b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} , which may be an approximation to the dominant eigenvector or a random vector. The method is described by the recurrence relation b k + 1 = A b k ‖ A b k ‖ {\\displaystyle b_{k+1}={\\frac {Ab_{k}}{\\|Ab_{k}\\|}}} So, at every iteration, the vector b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} is multiplied by the matrix A {\\displaystyle A} and normalized. If we assume A {\\displaystyle A} has an eigenvalue that is strictly greater in magnitude than its other eigenvalues and the starting vector b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} has a nonzero component in the direction of an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue, then a subsequence ( b k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(b_{k}\\right)} converges to an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue. Without the two assumptions above, the sequence ( b k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(b_{k}\\right)} does not necessarily converge. In this sequence, b k = e i ϕ k v 1 + r k {\\displaystyle b_{k}=e^{i\\phi _{k}}v_{1}+r_{k}} , where v 1 {\\displaystyle v_{1}} is an eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue, and ‖ r k ‖ → 0 {\\displaystyle \\|r_{k}\\|\\rightarrow 0} . The presence of the term e i ϕ k {\\displaystyle e^{i\\phi _{k}}} implies that ( b k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(b_{k}\\right)} does not converge unless e i ϕ k = 1 {\\displaystyle e^{i\\phi _{k}}=1} . Under the two assumptions listed above, the sequence ( μ k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(\\mu _{k}\\right)} defined by μ k = b k ∗ A b k b k ∗ b k {\\displaystyle \\mu _{k}={\\frac {b_{k}^{*}Ab_{k}}{b_{k}^{*}b_{k}}}} converges to the dominant eigenvalue (with Rayleigh quotient ). [ clarification needed ] One may compute this with the following algorithm (shown in Python with NumPy): #!/usr/bin/env python3 import numpy as np def power_iteration ( A , num_iterations : int ): # Ideally choose a random vector # To decrease the chance that our vector # Is orthogonal to the eigenvector b_k = np . random . rand ( A . shape [ 1 ]) for _ in range ( num_iterations ): # calculate the matrix-by-vector product Ab b_k1 = np . dot ( A , b_k ) # calculate the norm b_k1_norm = np . linalg . norm ( b_k1 ) # re normalize the vector b_k = b_k1 / b_k1_norm return b_k power_iteration ( np . array ([[ 0.5 , 0.5 ], [ 0.2 , 0.8 ]]), 10 ) The vector b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} converges to an associated eigenvector. Ideally, one should use the Rayleigh quotient in order to get the associated eigenvalue. This algorithm is used to calculate the Google PageRank . The method can also be used to calculate the spectral radius (the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude, for a square matrix) by computing the Rayleigh quotient ρ ( A ) = max { | λ 1 | , … , | λ n | } = b k ⊤ A b k b k ⊤ b k . {\\displaystyle \\rho (A)=\\max \\left\\{|\\lambda _{1}|,\\dotsc ,|\\lambda _{n}|\\right\\}={\\frac {b_{k}^{\\top }Ab_{k}}{b_{k}^{\\top }b_{k}}}.} Analysis [ edit ] Let A {\\displaystyle A} be decomposed into its Jordan canonical form : A = V J V − 1 {\\displaystyle A=VJV^{-1}} , where the first column of V {\\displaystyle V} is an eigenvector of A {\\displaystyle A} corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue λ 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}} . Since generically , the dominant eigenvalue of A {\\displaystyle A} is unique, the first Jordan block of J {\\displaystyle J} is the 1 × 1 {\\displaystyle 1\\times 1} matrix [ λ 1 ] , {\\displaystyle [\\lambda _{1}],} where λ 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}} is the largest eigenvalue of A in magnitude. The starting vector b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} can be written as a linear combination of the columns of V : b 0 = c 1 v 1 + c 2 v 2 + ⋯ + c n v n . {\\displaystyle b_{0}=c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}v_{n}.} By assumption, b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} has a nonzero component in the direction of the dominant eigenvector, so c 1 ≠ 0 {\\displaystyle c_{1}\\neq 0} . The computationally useful recurrence relation for b k + 1 {\\displaystyle b_{k+1}} can be rewritten as: b k + 1 = A b k ‖ A b k ‖ = A k + 1 b 0 ‖ A k + 1 b 0 ‖ , {\\displaystyle b_{k+1}={\\frac {Ab_{k}}{\\|Ab_{k}\\|}}={\\frac {A^{k+1}b_{0}}{\\|A^{k+1}b_{0}\\|}},} where the expression: A k + 1 b 0 ‖ A k + 1 b 0 ‖ {\\displaystyle {\\frac {A^{k+1}b_{0}}{\\|A^{k+1}b_{0}\\|}}} is more amenable to the following analysis. b k = A k b 0 ‖ A k b 0 ‖ = ( V J V − 1 ) k b 0 ‖ ( V J V − 1 ) k b 0 ‖ = V J k V − 1 b 0 ‖ V J k V − 1 b 0 ‖ = V J k V − 1 ( c 1 v 1 + c 2 v 2 + ⋯ + c n v n ) ‖ V J k V − 1 ( c 1 v 1 + c 2 v 2 + ⋯ + c n v n ) ‖ = V J k ( c 1 e 1 + c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ V J k ( c 1 e 1 + c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ = ( λ 1 | λ 1 | ) k c 1 | c 1 | v 1 + 1 c 1 V ( 1 λ 1 J ) k ( c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ v 1 + 1 c 1 V ( 1 λ 1 J ) k ( c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}b_{k}&={\\frac {A^{k}b_{0}}{\\|A^{k}b_{0}\\|}}\\\\&={\\frac {\\left(VJV^{-1}\\right)^{k}b_{0}}{\\|\\left(VJV^{-1}\\right)^{k}b_{0}\\|}}\\\\&={\\frac {VJ^{k}V^{-1}b_{0}}{\\|VJ^{k}V^{-1}b_{0}\\|}}\\\\&={\\frac {VJ^{k}V^{-1}\\left(c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}v_{n}\\right)}{\\|VJ^{k}V^{-1}\\left(c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}v_{n}\\right)\\|}}\\\\&={\\frac {VJ^{k}\\left(c_{1}e_{1}+c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)}{\\|VJ^{k}\\left(c_{1}e_{1}+c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)\\|}}\\\\&=\\left({\\frac {\\lambda _{1}}{|\\lambda _{1}|}}\\right)^{k}{\\frac {c_{1}}{|c_{1}|}}{\\frac {v_{1}+{\\frac {1}{c_{1}}}V\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}\\left(c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)}{\\left\\|v_{1}+{\\frac {1}{c_{1}}}V\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}\\left(c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)\\right\\|}}\\end{aligned}}} The expression above simplifies as k → ∞ {\\displaystyle k\\to \\infty } ( 1 λ 1 J ) k = [ [ 1 ] ( 1 λ 1 J 2 ) k ⋱ ( 1 λ 1 J m ) k ] → [ 1 0 ⋱ 0 ] as k → ∞ . {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}={\\begin{bmatrix}[1]&&&&\\\\&\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J_{2}\\right)^{k}&&&\\\\&&\\ddots &\\\\&&&\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J_{m}\\right)^{k}\\\\\\end{bmatrix}}\\rightarrow {\\begin{bmatrix}1&&&&\\\\&0&&&\\\\&&\\ddots &\\\\&&&0\\\\\\end{bmatrix}}\\quad {\\text{as}}\\quad k\\to \\infty .} The limit follows from the fact that the eigenvalue of 1 λ 1 J i {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J_{i}} is less than 1 in magnitude, so ( 1 λ 1 J i ) k → 0 as k → ∞ . {\\displaystyle \\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J_{i}\\right)^{k}\\to 0\\quad {\\text{as}}\\quad k\\to \\infty .} It follows that: 1 c 1 V ( 1 λ 1 J ) k ( c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) → 0 as k → ∞ {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1}{c_{1}}}V\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}\\left(c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)\\to 0\\quad {\\text{as}}\\quad k\\to \\infty } Using this fact, b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} can be written in a form that emphasizes its relationship with v 1 {\\displaystyle v_{1}} when k is large: b k = ( λ 1 | λ 1 | ) k c 1 | c 1 | v 1 + 1 c 1 V ( 1 λ 1 J ) k ( c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ v 1 + 1 c 1 V ( 1 λ 1 J ) k ( c 2 e 2 + ⋯ + c n e n ) ‖ = e i ϕ k c 1 | c 1 | v 1 ‖ v 1 ‖ + r k {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}b_{k}&=\\left({\\frac {\\lambda _{1}}{|\\lambda _{1}|}}\\right)^{k}{\\frac {c_{1}}{|c_{1}|}}{\\frac {v_{1}+{\\frac {1}{c_{1}}}V\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}\\left(c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)}{\\left\\|v_{1}+{\\frac {1}{c_{1}}}V\\left({\\frac {1}{\\lambda _{1}}}J\\right)^{k}\\left(c_{2}e_{2}+\\cdots +c_{n}e_{n}\\right)\\right\\|}}\\\\[6pt]&=e^{i\\phi _{k}}{\\frac {c_{1}}{|c_{1}|}}{\\frac {v_{1}}{\\|v_{1}\\|}}+r_{k}\\end{aligned}}} where e i ϕ k = ( λ 1 / | λ 1 | ) k {\\displaystyle e^{i\\phi _{k}}=\\left(\\lambda _{1}/|\\lambda _{1}|\\right)^{k}} and ‖ r k ‖ → 0 {\\displaystyle \\|r_{k}\\|\\to 0} as k → ∞ {\\displaystyle k\\to \\infty } The sequence ( b k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(b_{k}\\right)} is bounded, so it contains a convergent subsequence. Note that the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue is only unique up to a scalar, so although the sequence ( b k ) {\\displaystyle \\left(b_{k}\\right)} may not converge, b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} is nearly an eigenvector of A for large k . Alternatively, if A is diagonalizable , then the following proof yields the same result Let λ 1 , λ 2 , ..., λ m be the m eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) of A and let v 1 , v 2 , ..., v m be the corresponding eigenvectors. Suppose that λ 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}} is the dominant eigenvalue, so that | λ 1 | > | λ j | {\\displaystyle |\\lambda _{1}|>|\\lambda _{j}|} for j > 1 {\\displaystyle j>1} . The initial vector b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} can be written: b 0 = c 1 v 1 + c 2 v 2 + ⋯ + c m v m . {\\displaystyle b_{0}=c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{m}v_{m}.} If b 0 {\\displaystyle b_{0}} is chosen randomly (with uniform probability), then c 1 ≠ 0 with probability 1 . Now, A k b 0 = c 1 A k v 1 + c 2 A k v 2 + ⋯ + c m A k v m = c 1 λ 1 k v 1 + c 2 λ 2 k v 2 + ⋯ + c m λ m k v m = c 1 λ 1 k ( v 1 + c 2 c 1 ( λ 2 λ 1 ) k v 2 + ⋯ + c m c 1 ( λ m λ 1 ) k v m ) → c 1 λ 1 k v 1 | λ j λ 1 | < 1 for j > 1 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}A^{k}b_{0}&=c_{1}A^{k}v_{1}+c_{2}A^{k}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{m}A^{k}v_{m}\\\\&=c_{1}\\lambda _{1}^{k}v_{1}+c_{2}\\lambda _{2}^{k}v_{2}+\\cdots +c_{m}\\lambda _{m}^{k}v_{m}\\\\&=c_{1}\\lambda _{1}^{k}\\left(v_{1}+{\\frac {c_{2}}{c_{1}}}\\left({\\frac {\\lambda _{2}}{\\lambda _{1}}}\\right)^{k}v_{2}+\\cdots +{\\frac {c_{m}}{c_{1}}}\\left({\\frac {\\lambda _{m}}{\\lambda _{1}}}\\right)^{k}v_{m}\\right)\\\\&\\to c_{1}\\lambda _{1}^{k}v_{1}&&\\left|{\\frac {\\lambda _{j}}{\\lambda _{1}}}\\right|<1{\\text{ for }}j>1\\end{aligned}}} On the other hand: b k = A k b 0 ‖ A k b 0 ‖ . {\\displaystyle b_{k}={\\frac {A^{k}b_{0}}{\\|A^{k}b_{0}\\|}}.} Therefore, b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} converges to (a multiple of) the eigenvector v 1 {\\displaystyle v_{1}} . The convergence is geometric , with ratio | λ 2 λ 1 | , {\\displaystyle \\left|{\\frac {\\lambda _{2}}{\\lambda _{1}}}\\right|,} where λ 2 {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{2}} denotes the second dominant eigenvalue. Thus, the method converges slowly if there is an eigenvalue close in magnitude to the dominant eigenvalue. Applications [ edit ] Although the power iteration method approximates only one eigenvalue of a matrix, it remains useful for certain computational problems . For instance, Google uses it to calculate the PageRank of documents in their search engine, [ 2 ] and Twitter uses it to show users recommendations of whom to follow. [ 3 ] The power iteration method is especially suitable for sparse matrices , such as the web matrix, or as the matrix-free method that does not require storing the coefficient matrix A {\\displaystyle A} explicitly, but can instead access a function evaluating matrix-vector products A x {\\displaystyle Ax} . For non-symmetric matrices that are well-conditioned the power iteration method can outperform more complex Arnoldi iteration . For symmetric matrices, the power iteration method is rarely used, since its convergence speed can be easily increased without sacrificing the small cost per iteration; see, e.g., Lanczos iteration and LOBPCG . Some of the more advanced eigenvalue algorithms can be understood as variations of the power iteration. For instance, the inverse iteration method applies power iteration to the matrix A − 1 {\\displaystyle A^{-1}} . Other algorithms look at the whole subspace generated by the vectors b k {\\displaystyle b_{k}} . This subspace is known as the Krylov subspace . It can be computed by Arnoldi iteration or Lanczos iteration . Gram iteration [ 4 ] is a super-linear and deterministic method to compute the largest eigenpair.

Contents [ edit ] Google Patents indexes more than 87 million patents and patent applications with full text from 17 patent offices , including: United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), European Patent Office (EPO), China's National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), Japan Patent Office (JPO), Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt (DPMA), Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), Rospatent , Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom) , National Institute of Industrial Property (France) , the Netherlands Patent Office , offices of Spain, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, and Luxembourg. [ 1 ] These documents include the entire collection of granted patents and published patent applications from each database (which belong to the public domain ). US patent documents date back to 1790, EPO and WIPO to 1978. [ 2 ] Optical character recognition (OCR) has been performed on the older US patents to make them searchable , and Google Translate has been used on all non-English patents to make the English translations searchable. Google Patents also indexes documents from Google Scholar and Google Books , and has machine-classified them with Cooperative Patent Classification codes for searching. [ 3 ] Patent litigation information is also available in Google Patents through a partnership with Darts-ip, a global patent litigation database. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] History and background [ edit ] The service was launched on December 14, 2006. Google says it uses \"the same technology as that underlying Google Books \", [ 6 ] allowing scrolling through pages, and zooming in on areas. [ 7 ] The images are saveable as PNG files. Google Patents was updated in 2012 with coverage of the European Patent Office (EPO) and the Prior Art Finder tool. [ 8 ] In 2013, it was expanded to cover World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), German Patent Office ( German : Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt , DPMA), Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), and China's National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA). All foreign patents were also translated to English and made searchable. [ 9 ] In 2015, a new version was introduced at patents.google.com with a new UI, integration of Google Scholar with machine-classified with Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPCs), and search result clustering into CPCs. [ 10 ] In 2016, coverage of 11 additional patent offices was announced. [ 11 ] Support for the USPTO and EPO Boolean search syntax (proximity, wildcards, title/abstract/claims fields) was introduced, as well as visual graphs of inventors, assignees and CPCs by date, a thumbnail grid view of search results and downloadable result sets as CSV. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 2018, global litigation information has been added. Google Patents pages display if a patent (or any member of its family) has a litigation history anywhere in the world and provides a link to the Darts-ip patent cases database.

[ 1 ] In general, the higher ranked on the search results page and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these visitors can then be converted into customers. [ 2 ] Local SEO, however, differs in that it is focused on optimizing a business's online presence so that its web pages will be displayed by search engines when users enter local searches for its products or services. [ 3 ] Ranking for local search involves a similar process to general SEO but includes some specific elements to rank a business for local search. For example, local SEO is all about 'optimizing' your online presence to attract more business from relevant local searches. The majority of these searches take place on Google , Yahoo , Bing , Yandex , Baidu and other search engines but for better optimization in your local area you should also use sites like Yelp , Angie's List , LinkedIn , Local business directories, social media channels and others. [ 4 ] The birth of local SEO The origin of local SEO can be traced back [ 5 ] to 2003-2005 when search engines tried to provide people with results in their vicinity as well as additional information such as opening times of a store, listings in maps, etc. Local SEO has evolved over the years to provide a targeted online marketing approach that allows local businesses to appear based on a range of local search signals, providing a distinct difference from broader organic SEO which prioritises relevance of search over a distance of searcher. Local search results Local searches trigger search engines to display two types of results on the Search engine results page : local organic results and the 'Local Pack'. [ 3 ] The local organic results include web pages related to the search query with local relevance . These often include directories such as Yelp , Yellow Pages, Facebook , etc. [ 3 ] The Local Pack displays businesses that have signed up with Google and taken ownership of their ' Google My Business ' (GMB) listing. The information displayed in the GMB listing and hence in the Local Pack can come from different sources: [ 6 ] The owner of the business. This information can include opening/closing times, description of products or services, etc. Information is taken from the business's website User-provided information such as reviews or uploaded photos Information from other sources such as social profiles etc. Structured Data taken from Wikidata and Wikipedia . Data from these sources is part of the information that appears in Google's Knowledge Panel in the search results. Depending on the searches, Google can show relevant local results in Google Maps or Search. This is true on both mobile and desktop devices. [ 7 ] Google Maps Google has added a new Q&A features to Google Maps allowing users to submit questions to owners and allowing these to respond. [ 8 ] This Q&A feature is tied to the associated Google My Business account. Google Business Profile Google Business Profile (GBP), formerly Google My Business (GMB) is a free tool that allows businesses to create and manage their Google Business listing. These listings must represent a physical location that a customer can visit. A Google Business listing appears when customers search for businesses either on Google Maps or in Google SERPs. The accuracy of these listings is a local ranking factor. Ranking factors Local Online Marketing Major search engines have algorithms that determine which local businesses rank in local search. Primary factors that impact a local business's chance of appearing in local search include proper categorization in business directories, a business's name, address, and phone number (NAP) being crawlable on the website, and citations (mentions of the local business on other relevant websites like a chamber of commerce website). [ 9 ] In 2016, a study using statistical analysis assessed how and why businesses ranked in the Local Packs and identified positive correlations between local rankings and 100+ ranking factors. [ 10 ] Although the study cannot replicate Google's algorithm, it did deliver several interesting findings: Backlinks showed the most important correlation (and also Google's Toolbar PageRank , suggesting that older links are an advantage because the Toolbar has not been updated in a long time). Sites with more content (hence more keywords ) tended to fare better (as expected). Reviews on GMB also were found to strongly correlate with high rankings. Other GMB factors, like the presence of photos and having a verified GMB page with opening hours, showed a positive correlation (with ranking) albeit not as important as reviews. The quality of citations such as a low number of duplicates, consistency and also a fair number of citations, mattered for a business to show in Local Packs. However, within the pack, citations did not influence their ranking: \"citations appear to be foundational but not a competitive advantage.\" The authors were instead surprised that geotargeting elements (city & state) in the title of the GMB landing page did not have any impact on GMB rankings. Hence the authors suggest using such elements only if it makes sense for usability reasons. The presence of a keyword in the business name was found to be one of the most important factors (explaining the high incidence of spam in the Local Pack). Schema structured data is a ranking factor. The addition of the 'LocalBusiness' markup will enable you to display relevant information about your business to Google. This includes opening hours, address, founder, parent company information and much more. [ 11 ] The number of reviews and overall star rating correlates with higher rankings in the Google map pack results. Local ranking according to Google Prominence, relevance, and distance are the three main criteria Google claims to use in its algorithms to show results that best match a user's query. [ 12 ] Prominence reflects how well-known is a place in the offline world. An important museum or store, for example, will be given more prominence. Google also uses information obtained on the web to assess prominence such as review counts, links, articles. Relevance refers to Google's algorithms attempt to surface the listings that best match the user's query . Distance refers to Google's attempt to return those listings that are the closest the location terms used in a user's query. If no location term is used then \"Google will calculate distance based on what's known about their location\". Local ranking: 2017 survey from 40 local experts According to a group of local SEO experts who took part in a survey, links and reviews are more important than ever to rank locally. [ 13 ] Near Me Queries As a result of both Google as well as Apple offering \"near me\" as an option to users, some authors [ 14 ] report on how Google Trends shows very significant increases in \"near me\" queries. The same authors also report that the factors correlating the most with Local Pack ranking for \"near me\" queries include the presence of the \"searched city and state in backlinks' anchor text\" as well as the use of the \" 'near me' in internal link anchor text\" Possum Update An important update to Google's local algorithm, rolled out on the 1st of September 2016. [ 15 ] Summary of the update on local search results: Businesses based outside city physical limits showed a significant increase in ranking in the Google Local Pack A more restrictive filter is in place. Before the update, Google filtered listings linking to the same website and using the same phone number. After the update, listings get filtered if they have the same address and same categories though they belong to different businesses. So, if several dentists share the same address, Google will only show one of them. Hawk update As previously explained (see above), the Possum update led similar listings, within the same building, or even located on the same street, to get filtered. As a result, only one listing \"with greater organic ranking and stronger relevance to the keyword\" would be shown. [ 16 ] After the Hawk update on 22 August 2017, this filtering seems to apply only to listings located within the same building or close by (e.g. 50 feet), but not to listings located further away (e.g.325 feet away). [ 16 ] Fake reviews As previously explained (see above), reviews are deemed to be an important ranking factor. Joy Hawkins, a Google Top Contributor and local SEO expert, highlights the problems due to fake reviews: [ 17 ] Lack of an appropriate process for business owners to report fake reviews on competitors' sites. GMB support will not consider requests about businesses other than if they come from the business owners themselves. So if a competitor nearby has been collecting fake reviews, the only way to bring this to the attention of GMB is via the Google My Business Forum. Unlike Yelp, Google does not show a label warning users of abnormal review behavior for those businesses that buy reviews or that receive unnatural numbers of negative reviews because of media attention. Current Google algorithms do not identify unnatural review patterns. Abnormal review patterns often do not need human gauging and should be easily identified by algorithms. As a result, both fake listings and rogue reviewer profiles should be suspended.

The Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) was an academic publishing service, founded by Eugene Garfield in Philadelphia in 1956. [ 1 ] ISI offered scientometric and bibliographic database services. Its specialty was citation indexing and analysis, a field pioneered by Garfield. Services [ edit ] ISI maintained citation databases covering thousands of academic journals , including a continuation of its longtime print-based indexing service the Science Citation Index (SCI), as well as the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and the Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI). All of these were available via ISI's Web of Knowledge database service. This database allows a researcher to identify which articles have been cited most frequently, and who has cited them. The database provides some measure of the academic impact of the papers indexed in it, and may increase their impact by making them more visible and providing them with a quality label. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that appearing in this database can double the number of citations received by a given paper. [ 2 ] The company's main product was Current Contents , which gathers the tables of contents for recent academic journals. [ 1 ] The ISI also published the annual Journal Citation Reports which list an impact factor for each of the journals that it tracked. Within the scientific community, journal impact factors continue to play a large but controversial role in determining the kudos attached to a scientist's published research record. A list of over 14,000 journals was maintained by the ISI. The list included some 1,100 arts and humanities journals as well as scientific journals. Listings were based on published selection criteria and are an indicator of journal quality and impact. [ 3 ] ISI published Science Watch , a newsletter which every two months identified one paper published in the previous two years as a \"fast-breaking paper\" in each of 22 broad fields of science, such as Mathematics (including Statistics ), Engineering , Biology , Chemistry , and Physics . [ citation needed ] The designations were based on the number of citations and the largest increase from one bimonthly update to the next. Articles about the papers often included comments by the authors. The ISI also published a list of \"ISI Highly Cited Researchers \", one of the factors included in the Academic Ranking of World Universities published by Shanghai Jiao Tong University . This continues under Clarivate. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Initially, the company was named Documation. [ 1 ] In 1992, ISI was acquired by Thomson Scientific & Healthcare , [ 5 ] and became known as Thomson ISI . It was a part of the Intellectual Property & Science business of Thomson Reuters until 2016, when the IP & Science business was sold, becoming Clarivate Analytics . [ 6 ] Clarivate has since established ISI as part of its Scientific and Academic Research group. [ 7 ] [ 4 ] ISI Highly Cited [ edit ] Main article: Highly Cited Researchers program \"ISI Highly Cited\" is a database of \"highly cited researchers\"—scientific researchers whose publications are most often cited in academic journals over the past decade, published by the Institute for Scientific Information. Inclusion in this list is taken as a measure of the esteem of these academics and is used, for example, by the Academic Ranking of World Universities . It was founded under ISI and as of 2018 continues under the same name at Clarivate. [ 4 ] The methodology for inclusion is to consider papers in the upper first percentile based on citation counts [ 8 ] of all articles indexed in the Scientific Citation Databases and published in a single, fixed year. Papers in the upper first percentile with respect to their year of publication are called highly cited papers. Each paper in the data is assigned to one or more of 21 categories, based on the ISI classification of the journal in which the article was published. The Highly Cited Researchers list is compiled by selecting, in every field, those researchers with the highest number of highly cited papers in a 10-year, rolling time period. The number of highly cited researchers varies from field to field and is determined accordingly to the total number of researchers contributing to the single field. The categories are: Agricultural Sciences Biology & Biochemistry Chemistry Clinical Medicine Computer Science Ecology/Environment Economics/Business Engineering Geosciences Immunology Materials Science Mathematics Microbiology Molecular Biology & Genetics Neuroscience Pharmacology Physics Plant & Animal Science Psychology/Psychiatry Social Sciences – General Space Sciences The publication list and biographical details supplied by the researchers are freely available online, although general access to the ISI citation database is by subscription.

Relationships may be identified among various types of nodes, including organizations , people and transactions . Link analysis has been used for investigation of criminal activity ( fraud , counterterrorism , and intelligence ), computer security analysis , search engine optimization , market research , medical research , and art. Knowledge discovery [ edit ] Knowledge discovery is an iterative and interactive process used to identify , analyze and visualize patterns in data. [ 1 ] Network analysis, link analysis and social network analysis are all methods of knowledge discovery, each a corresponding subset of the prior method. Most knowledge discovery methods follow these steps (at the highest level): [ 2 ] Data processing Transformation Analysis Visualization Data gathering and processing requires access to data and has several inherent issues, including information overload and data errors. Once data is collected, it will need to be transformed into a format that can be effectively used by both human and computer analyzers. Manual or computer-generated visualizations tools may be mapped from the data, including network charts. Several algorithms exist to help with analysis of data – Dijkstra's algorithm , breadth-first search , and depth-first search . Link analysis focuses on analysis of relationships among nodes through visualization methods ( network charts , association matrix). Here is an example of the relationships that may be mapped for crime investigations: [ 3 ] Relationship/Network Data Sources 1. Trust Prior contacts in family, neighborhood, school, military, club or organization. Public and court records. Data may only be available in suspect's native country. 2. Task Logs and records of phone calls, electronic mail, chat rooms, instant messages, Web site visits. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. 3. Money & Resources Bank account and money transfer records. Pattern and location of credit card use. Prior court records. Human intelligence: observation of visits to alternate banking resources such as Hawala . 4. Strategy & Goals Web sites. Videos and encrypted disks delivered by courier. Travel records. Human intelligence: observation of meetings and attendance at common events. Link analysis is used for 3 primary purposes: [ 4 ] Find matches in data for known patterns of interest; Find anomalies where known patterns are violated; Discover new patterns of interest (social network analysis, data mining ). History [ edit ] Klerks categorized link analysis tools into 3 generations. [ 5 ] The first generation was introduced in 1975 as the Anacpapa Chart of Harper and Harris. [ 6 ] This method requires that a domain expert review data files, identify associations by constructing an association matrix, create a link chart for visualization and finally analyze the network chart to identify patterns of interest. This method requires extensive domain knowledge and is extremely time-consuming when reviewing vast amounts of data. Association Matrix In addition to the association matrix, the activities matrix can be used to produce actionable information, which has practical value and use to law-enforcement. The activities matrix, as the term might imply, centers on the actions and activities of people with respect to locations. Whereas the association matrix focuses on the relationships between people, organizations, and/or properties. The distinction between these two types of matrices, while minor, is nonetheless significant in terms of the output of the analysis completed or rendered. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Second generation tools consist of automatic graphics-based analysis tools such as IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook, Netmap, ClueMaker and Watson. These tools offer the ability to automate the construction and updates of the link chart once an association matrix is manually created, however, analysis of the resulting charts and graphs still requires an expert with extensive domain knowledge. The third generation of link-analysis tools like DataWalk allow the automatic visualization of linkages between elements in a data set, that can then serve as the canvas for further exploration or manual updates. Applications [ edit ] FBI Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) Iowa State Sex Crimes Analysis System Minnesota State Sex Crimes Analysis System (MIN/SCAP) Washington State Homicide Investigation Tracking System (HITS) [ 11 ] New York State Homicide Investigation & Lead Tracking (HALT) New Jersey Homicide Evaluation & Assessment Tracking (HEAT) [ 12 ] Pennsylvania State ATAC Program. Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System (ViCLAS) [ 13 ] Issues with link analysis [ edit ] Information overload [ edit ] With the vast amounts of data and information that are stored electronically, users are confronted with multiple unrelated sources of information available for analysis. Data analysis techniques are required to make effective and efficient use of the data. Palshikar classifies data analysis techniques into two categories – ( statistical models , time-series analysis , clustering and classification , matching algorithms to detect anomalies) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (data mining, expert systems , pattern recognition , machine learning techniques , neural networks ). [ 14 ] Bolton & Hand define statistical data analysis as either supervised or unsupervised methods. [ 15 ] Supervised learning methods require that rules are defined within the system to establish what is expected or unexpected behavior. Unsupervised learning methods review data in comparison to the norm and detect statistical outliers. Supervised learning methods are limited in the scenarios that can be handled as this method requires that training rules are established based on previous patterns. Unsupervised learning methods can provide detection of broader issues, however, may result in a higher false-positive ratio if the behavioral norm is not well established or understood. Data itself has inherent issues including integrity (or lack of) and continuous changes. Data may contain \"errors of omission and commission because of faulty collection or handling, and when entities are actively attempting to deceive and/or conceal their actions\". [ 4 ] Sparrow [ 16 ] highlights incompleteness (inevitability of missing data or links), fuzzy boundaries (subjectivity in deciding what to include) and dynamic changes (recognition that data is ever-changing) as the three primary problems with data analysis. [ 3 ] Once data is transformed into a usable format, open texture and cross referencing issues may arise. Open texture was defined by Waismann as the unavoidable uncertainty in meaning when empirical terms are used in different contexts. [ 17 ] Uncertainty in meaning of terms presents problems when attempting to search and cross reference data from multiple sources. [ 18 ] The primary method for resolving data analysis issues is reliance on domain knowledge from an expert. This is a very time-consuming and costly method of conducting link analysis and has inherent problems of its own. McGrath et al. conclude that the layout and presentation of a network diagram have a significant impact on the user's \"perceptions of the existence of groups in networks\". [ 19 ] Even using domain experts may result in differing conclusions as analysis may be subjective. Prosecution vs. crime prevention [ edit ] Link analysis techniques have primarily been used for prosecution, as it is far easier to review historical data for patterns than it is to attempt to predict future actions. Krebs demonstrated the use of an association matrix and link chart of the terrorist network associated with the 19 hijackers responsible for the September 11th attacks by mapping publicly available details made available following the attacks. [ 3 ] Even with the advantages of hindsight and publicly available information on people, places and transactions, it is clear that there is missing data. Alternatively, Picarelli argued that use of link analysis techniques could have been used to identify and potentially prevent illicit activities within the Aum Shinrikyo network. [ 20 ] \"We must be careful of 'guilt by association'. Being linked to a terrorist does not prove guilt – but it does invite investigation.\" [ 3 ] Balancing the legal concepts of probable cause , right to privacy and freedom of association become challenging when reviewing potentially sensitive data with the objective to prevent crime or illegal activity that has not yet occurred. Proposed solutions [ edit ] There are four categories of proposed link analysis solutions: [ 21 ] Heuristic-based Template-based Similarity-based Statistical Heuristic-based tools utilize decision rules that are distilled from expert knowledge using structured data. Template-based tools employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract details from unstructured data that are matched to pre-defined templates. Similarity-based approaches use weighted scoring to compare attributes and identify potential links. Statistical approaches identify potential links based on lexical statistics. CrimeNet explorer [ edit ] J.J. Xu and H. Chen propose a framework for automated network analysis and visualization called CrimeNet Explorer. [ 22 ] This framework includes the following elements: Network Creation through a concept space approach that uses \" co-occurrence weight to measure the frequency with which two words or phrases appear in the same document. The more frequently two words or phrases appear together, the more likely it will be that they are related\". [ 22 ] Network Partition using \"hierarchical clustering to partition a network into subgroups based on relational strength\". [ 22 ] Structural Analysis through \"three centrality measures (degree, betweenness, and closeness) to identify central members in a given subgroup. [ 22 ] CrimeNet Explorer employed Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm to calculate the betweenness and closeness from a single node to all other nodes in the subgroup. Network Visualization using Torgerson's metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm. References [ edit ] ^ Inc., The Tor Project. \"Tor Project: Overview\" .

Google matrix of Wikipedia articles network, written in the bases of PageRank index; fragment of top 200 X 200 matrix elements is shown, total size N=3282257 (from [ 1 ] ) A Google matrix is a particular stochastic matrix that is used by Google 's PageRank algorithm. The matrix represents a graph with edges representing links between pages. The PageRank of each page can then be generated iteratively from the Google matrix using the power method . However, in order for the power method to converge, the matrix must be stochastic, irreducible and aperiodic . Adjacency matrix A and Markov matrix S [ edit ] In order to generate the Google matrix G , we must first generate an adjacency matrix A which represents the relations between pages or nodes. Assuming there are N pages, we can fill out A by doing the following: A matrix element A i , j {\\displaystyle A_{i,j}} is filled with 1 if node j {\\displaystyle j} has a link to node i {\\displaystyle i} , and 0 otherwise; this is the adjacency matrix of links. A related matrix S corresponding to the transitions in a Markov chain of given network is constructed from A by dividing the elements of column \"j\" by a number of k j = Σ i = 1 N A i , j {\\displaystyle k_{j}=\\Sigma _{i=1}^{N}A_{i,j}} where k j {\\displaystyle k_{j}} is the total number of outgoing links from node j to all other nodes. The columns having zero matrix elements, corresponding to dangling nodes, are replaced by a constant value 1/N . Such a procedure adds a link from every sink, dangling state a {\\displaystyle a} to every other node. Now by the construction the sum of all elements in any column of matrix S is equal to unity. In this way the matrix S is mathematically well defined and it belongs to the class of Markov chains and the class of Perron-Frobenius operators. That makes S suitable for the PageRank algorithm. Construction of Google matrix G [ edit ] Fig.2. Google matrix of Cambridge University network (2006), coarse-grained matrix elements are written in the bases of PageRank index, total size N=212710 is shown (from [ 1 ] ) Then the final Google matrix G can be expressed via S as: G i j = α S i j + ( 1 − α ) 1 N ( 1 ) {\\displaystyle G_{ij}=\\alpha S_{ij}+(1-\\alpha ){\\frac {1}{N}}\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(1)} By the construction the sum of all non-negative elements inside each matrix column is equal to unity. The numerical coefficient α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } is known as a damping factor. Usually S is a sparse matrix and for modern directed networks it has only about ten nonzero elements in a line or column, thus only about 10 N multiplications are needed to multiply a vector by matrix G . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Examples of Google matrix [ edit ] An example of the matrix S {\\displaystyle S} construction via Eq.(1) within a simple network is given in the article CheiRank . For the actual matrix, Google uses a damping factor α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } around 0.85. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The term ( 1 − α ) {\\displaystyle (1-\\alpha )} gives a surfer probability to jump randomly on any page. The matrix G {\\displaystyle G} belongs to the class of Perron-Frobenius operators of Markov chains . [ 2 ] The examples of Google matrix structure are shown in Fig.1 for Wikipedia articles hyperlink network in 2009 at small scale and in Fig.2 for University of Cambridge network in 2006 at large scale. Spectrum and eigenstates of G matrix [ edit ] Fig3. The spectrum of eigenvalues of the Google matrix of University of Cambridge from Fig.2 at α = 1 {\\displaystyle \\alpha =1} , blue points show eigenvalues of isolated subspaces, red points show eigenvalues of core component (from [ 5 ] ) For 0 < α < 1 {\\displaystyle 0<\\alpha <1} there is only one maximal eigenvalue λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} with the corresponding right eigenvector which has non-negative elements P i {\\displaystyle P_{i}} which can be viewed as stationary probability distribution. [ 2 ] These probabilities ordered by their decreasing values give the PageRank vector P i {\\displaystyle P_{i}} with the PageRank K i {\\displaystyle K_{i}} used by Google search to rank webpages. Usually one has for the World Wide Web that P ∝ 1 / K β {\\displaystyle P\\propto 1/K^{\\beta }} with β ≈ 0.9 {\\displaystyle \\beta \\approx 0.9} . The number of nodes with a given PageRank value scales as N P ∝ 1 / P ν {\\displaystyle N_{P}\\propto 1/P^{\\nu }} with the exponent ν = 1 + 1 / β ≈ 2.1 {\\displaystyle \\nu =1+1/\\beta \\approx 2.1} . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The left eigenvector at λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} has constant matrix elements. With 0 < α {\\displaystyle 0<\\alpha } all eigenvalues move as λ i → α λ i {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{i}\\rightarrow \\alpha \\lambda _{i}} except the maximal eigenvalue λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} , which remains unchanged. [ 2 ] The PageRank vector varies with α {\\displaystyle \\alpha } but other eigenvectors with λ i < 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{i}<1} remain unchanged due to their orthogonality to the constant left vector at λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} . The gap between λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} and other eigenvalue being 1 − α ≈ 0.15 {\\displaystyle 1-\\alpha \\approx 0.15} gives a rapid convergence of a random initial vector to the PageRank approximately after 50 multiplications on G {\\displaystyle G} matrix. Fig4. Distribution of eigenvalues λ i {\\displaystyle \\lambda _{i}} of Google matrices in the complex plane at α = 1 {\\displaystyle \\alpha =1} for dictionary networks: Roget (A, N=1022), ODLIS (B, N=2909) and FOLDOC (C, N=13356); UK university WWW networks: University of Wales (Cardiff) (D, N=2778), Birmingham City University (E, N=10631), Keele University (Staffordshire) (F, N=11437), Nottingham Trent University (G, N=12660), Liverpool John Moores University (H, N=13578)(data for universities are for 2002) (from [ 8 ] ) At α = 1 {\\displaystyle \\alpha =1} the matrix G {\\displaystyle G} has generally many degenerate eigenvalues λ = 1 {\\displaystyle \\lambda =1} (see e.g. [6] [ 8 ] ). Examples of the eigenvalue spectrum of the Google matrix of various directed networks is shown in Fig.3 from [ 5 ] and Fig.4 from. [ 8 ] The Google matrix can be also constructed for the Ulam networks generated by the Ulam method [8] for dynamical maps. The spectral properties of such matrices are discussed in [9,10,11,12,13,15]. [ 5 ] [ 9 ] In a number of cases the spectrum is described by the fractal Weyl law [10,12]. Fig5. Distribution of eigenvalues λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } in the complex plane for the Google matrix G {\\displaystyle G} of the Linux Kernel version 2.6.32 with matrix size N = 285509 {\\displaystyle N=285509} at α = 0.85 {\\displaystyle \\alpha =0.85} , unit circle is shown by solid curve (from [ 9 ] ) Fig.6 Coarse-grained probability distribution for the eigenstates of the Google matrix for Linux Kernel version 2.6.32. The horizontal lines show the first 64 eigenvectors ordered vertically by | λ i | {\\displaystyle |\\lambda _{i}|} (from [ 9 ] ) The Google matrix can be constructed also for other directed networks, e.g. for the procedure call network of the Linux Kernel software introduced in [15]. In this case the spectrum of λ {\\displaystyle \\lambda } is described by the fractal Weyl law with the fractal dimension d ≈ 1.3 {\\displaystyle d\\approx 1.3} (see Fig.5 from [ 9 ] ). Numerical analysis shows that the eigenstates of matrix G {\\displaystyle G} are localized (see Fig.6 from [ 9 ] ). Arnoldi iteration method allows to compute many eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrices of rather large size [13]. [ 5 ] [ 9 ] Other examples of G {\\displaystyle G} matrix include the Google matrix of brain [17] and business process management [18], see also. [ 1 ] Applications of Google matrix analysis to DNA sequences is described in [20]. Such a Google matrix approach allows also to analyze entanglement of cultures via ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles abouts persons [21] Historical notes [ edit ] The Google matrix with damping factor was described by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998 [22], see also articles on PageRank history [23],[24].

It was discontinued on July 20, 2011. However, the Google business places and recommended businesses is now commonly referred to as the Google directory. [ 1 ] Information [ edit ] The Google Directory was organized into 16 main categories. The directory with its upper level topics and sub-categories could provide more specific results than the usual keyword search. [ 2 ] Arts Business Computers Games Health Home Kids and teens News Recreation Reference Regional Science Shopping Society Sports World The World link offered the directory in other languages. The Kids and Teens link was a separate web archive for kids and teens. The Google Directory was based on the Open Directory Project . [ 3 ] Unlike the keyword search function of Google, the directory organization was created by humans. [ 2 ] Structure [ edit ] Main page [ edit ] The main page had links to the 16 main categories, [ 4 ] along with the World and Kids and Teens links. There was a search box on top that allowed users to search the Google Directory. On top of that was the slogan in green letters: \"The web organized by topic into categories.\" On top of that were links to other Google services. Main category pages [ edit ] Each main category page had links to sub-main category pages in alphabetical order, as well as a search box on top of it. Each sub-category entry is followed by a number that gives the number of items in that sub-category. [ 4 ] Sub-categories would be created as needed, and eventually the user would get to a page with no more subcategories. Each page might have links to related categories. Some links were redirects to other pages. World link [ edit ] The World link had the names of languages. If the user clicked on one, they would be taken to a version of the directory in that language. [ 2 ] Kids and Teens [ edit ] As the name states, it had pages for kids and teens. It was completely disconnected from the rest of the directory, so if you clicked it by accident, you would have to press the back button on your web browser. Connection with the Open Directory Project [ edit ] The Google Directory was completely built upon the Open Directory Project. Google integrated its PageRank system and its search system into it. Everything was green. There were links on the bottom so that the user could contribute to it. Trivia [ edit ] If a search result was also in the directory, Google included a link to the respecting category. If someone wanted to have a listing in the Google Directory, they would have to be listed in the Open Directory Project . External links [ edit ] An archived copy of the Directory is available on the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive . One such entry is here . Example of a World page of alternate languages.

[ 5 ] It manifests as a post, image, video, article or editorial piece of content. In some cases, it functions like an advertorial . The word native refers to the coherence of the content with the other media that appear on the platform. These ads reduce a consumer's ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, even if it is labeled as \"sponsored\" or \"branded\" content. [ 6 ] Readers may have difficulty immediately identifying them as advertisements due to their ambiguous nature, especially when deceptive labels such as \"From around the web\" are used. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Since the early 2000s, the US FTC has required content that is paid for by advertisers and not created by the publisher as content to be labeled. There are different terms advertisers can use but in all cases the ad content must be clearly labeled as ad. According to the FTC: \"The listings should be clearly labeled as such using terms conveying that the rank is paid for.\" [ 2 ] Some studies have linked native advertising to ad-evoked effects, such as increased attention to an ad, [ 8 ] reduced ad avoidance, [ 8 ] increased purchase intention, [ 9 ] and favorable attitude toward a brand. [ 9 ] These types of integrated advertisements allow businesses to be associated with content that is already being consumed. [ 10 ] Product placement (embedded marketing) is a precursor to native advertising. The former places the product within the content, whereas in native marketing, which is legally permissible in the US to the extent that there is sufficient disclosure, [ 11 ] the product and content are merged. Forms [ edit ] Contemporary formats for native advertising now include promoted videos, images, articles, commentary, music, and other various forms of media. A majority of these methods for delivering the native strategy have been relegated to an online presence, where it is most commonly employed as publisher-produced brand content, a similar concept to the traditional advertorial. Alternative examples of modern technique include search advertising , when ads appear alongside search results that qualify as native to the search experience. Popular examples include Twitter 's promoted Tweets , Facebook 's promoted stories, and Tumblr 's promoted posts. The most traditionally influenced form of native marketing manifests as the placement of sponsor-funded content alongside editorial content, [ 12 ] or showing \"other content you might be interested in\" which is sponsored by a marketer alongside editorial recommendations. [ 13 ] This 1901 advertisement for patent medicine presents itself as an editorial on political developments in China. Most recently, controversy has arisen as to whether content marketing is a form of native marketing, or if they are inherently separate ideologies and styles, with native market strategists claiming that they utilize content marketing techniques, and some content market strategists claiming not to be a form of native marketing. [ citation needed ] Sponsored content (content marketing) [ edit ] Recently [ timeframe? ] , the most notable form of native advertising has been sponsored content. The production of sponsored content (sometimes abbreviated as \"sponcon\" [ 14 ] ) involves inclusion of a third party along with a management company or a brand company's personal relations and promotional activities team in reaching out to aforementioned considerably popular third party content producers on social media , often independent, deemed \" influencers \" in an attempt to promote a product. Often quoted as the predecessor to traditional endorsed and/or contract advertising ; which would instead be featuring celebrities, sponsored content has indubitably become more and more popular on social media platforms in recent years likely due to their cost-effectiveness, time efficiency, as well as the ability to receive instant feedback on the marketability of a product or service. [ citation needed ] A technique often used in traditional sponsored advertising is direct and indirect product placement (embedded marketing). Instead of embedded marketing's technique of placing the product within the content, in native marketing, the product and content are merged, and in sponsored content the product, content and active promotion occurs simultaneously across a number of platforms. [ 15 ] Unlike traditional forms of native advertising, sponsored content alludes to requirement of and desire for transparency and thrives on the concept of preexisting and/or built up trust between consumer and content producer rather than creating a masked net impression, which is a reasonable consumer's understanding of an advertisement. The underlying motives of sponsored content, however, is similar to that of native advertising- which is to inhibit a consumers' ad recognition by blending the ad into the native content of the platform, making many consumers unaware they are looking at an ad to begin with. The sponsored content on social media, like any other type of native advertising, can be difficult to be properly identified by the Federal Trade Commission because of its ambiguous nature. Native advertising frequently bypasses this net impression standard, which makes it problematic. [ citation needed ] Categories of sponsored content [ edit ] Sponsored videos [ edit ] Sponsored videos involve the content producer/influencer including or mentioning the service/product for a particular amount of time within their video. This type of sponsorship is evident across all genres and levels of production regarding video content. There is a history of trouble between content producers and their transparency of sponsors regarding endorsement guidelines set by the Federal Trades Commission . [ 16 ] Most sponsored videos include a brief or a contract and can vary from client to client and affects the nature of promotion of the product as well as specific requirements such as length of the promotion period. Notable companies involved in this trade include Audible , Squarespace , Crunchyroll and Vanity Planet. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Sponsored social media posts [ edit ] Sponsored social media posts usually consist of the content producer/influencer including or mentioning the service/product for a particular amount of time within a single or series of social media posts. Most sponsored posts include a brief or a contract and can vary from client to client. Notable companies involved in this trade include fit-tea, sugar bear hair and various diet meal planning services and watch brands. [ 19 ] Collaborative content [ edit ] Collaborative content has become more prominent on video platforms and social media in recent years. Content producers/influencers are usually contacted by companies for their creative input and voice in the makings of a product or provided with a discount code to gain a percentage of the profits after consumers incorporate the code as a part their purchase. Collaborative content may also include a brief or a contract and can vary from client to client- however, there is a degree of flexibility as the finished product is supposedly a representation of the content producer. Notable companies involved in this trade include pixi, colourpop and MAC cosmetics. [ 20 ] Advertising disclosure [ edit ] As it is the nature of disguised advertising to blend with its surroundings, a clear disclosure is deemed necessary when employing native marketing strategy in order to protect the consumer from being deceived, and to assist audiences in distinguishing between sponsored and regular content. According to the Federal Trade Commission , means of disclosure include visual cues, labels, and other techniques. [ 21 ] The most common practices of these are recognizable by understated labels, such as “Advertisement”, “Ad”, “Promoted”, “Sponsored”, “Featured Partner”, or “Suggested Post” in subtitles, corners, or the bottoms of ads. A widespread tendency in such measures is to mention the brand name of the sponsor, as in “Promoted by [brand]”, “Sponsored by [brand]”, or “Presented by [brand]”. [ 22 ] These can vary drastically due to the publisher's choice of disclosure language (i.e., wording used to identify native advertising placement). [ 23 ] In 2009, the Federal Trade Commission released their Endorsement Guideline specifically to increase consumer awareness of endorsements and testimonials in advertising given the rise in popularity of social media and blogging. [ 24 ] The American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) released updated guidelines in 2015 reaffirming the need of publishers to distinguish editorial and advertising content. The ASME approach recommends both labels to disclose commercial sponsorship and in-content visual evidence to help the user distinguish native advertising from editorial. [ 25 ] A study published by University of California researchers found that even labeled native advertising deceived about a quarter of survey research subjects. In the study, 27% of respondents thought that journalists or editors wrote an advertorial for diet pills, despite the presence of the \"Sponsored Content\" label. Because the Federal Trade Commission can bring cases concerning practices that mislead a substantial minority of consumers, the authors conclude that many native advertising campaigns are probably deceptive under federal law. The authors also explain two theories of why native advertising is deceptive. First, the schema theory suggests that advertorials mislead by causing consumers not to trigger their innate skepticism to advertising. Second, advertorials also cause source-based misleadingness problems by imbuing advertising material with the authority normally assigned to editorial content. [ 26 ] Recognition percentages remain low even as native advertising has expanded in pervasiveness. An academic article published in 2017 has shown that only 17% of participants could identify native advertising and even if readers were primed, that number only increased to 27%. Moreover, when readers learned about covert advertising, their perceptions of the publications declined. [ 27 ] Categories of online ads [ edit ] The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), the primary organization responsible for developing ad industry standards and conducting business research, published a report in 2013 [ 22 ] detailing six different categories for differentiating types of native advertisements. In-Feed Ad Units: As the name denotes, In-Feed ads are units located within the website's normal content feed, meaning they appear as if the content may have been written by or in partnership with the publisher's team to match the surrounding stories. A category that rose to popularity through sites like Upworthy and Buzzfeed 's sponsored articles due to its effectiveness, In-Feed has also been the source of controversy for native marketing, as it is here the distinction between native and content marketing is typically asserted. Search Ads: Appearing in the list of search results, these are generally found above or below the organic search results or in favorable position, having been sold to advertisers with a guarantee for optimal placement on the search engine page. They usually possess a similar appearance as the organic results on the page with the exception of disclosure aspects. Recommendation Widgets: Although these ads are part of the content of the site, these do not tend to appear in like manner to the content of the editorial feed. Typically delivered through a widget, recommendation ads are generally recognizable by words which imply external reference, suggestions, and tangentially related topics. \"You might also like\"; \"You might like\"; “Elsewhere from around the web\"; \"From around the web\"; \"You may have missed\", or \"Recommended for you\" typically characterize these units. Promoted Listings: Usually featured on websites that are not content based, such as e-commerce sites, promoted listings are presented in identical fashion with the products or services offered on the given site. Similarly justified as search ads, sponsored products are considered native to the experience in much the same way as search ads. In-Ad (IAB Standard): An In-Ad fits in a standard IAB container found outside the feed, containing \"...contextually relevant content within the ad, links to an offsite page, has been sold with a guaranteed placement, and is measured on brand metrics such as interaction and brand lift.\" Custom / Can't be Contained: This category is left for the odd ends and ads that do not conform to any of the other content categories. Digital platforms [ edit ] Native advertising platforms are classified into two categories, commonly referred to as \"open\" and \"closed\" platforms, but hybrid options are also utilized with some frequency. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Closed platforms are formats created by brands for the purpose of promoting their own content intrinsically on their websites. Advertisements seen on these platforms will not be seen on others, as these ad types are generated for its sole use, and structured around exhibiting ad units within the confines of the website's specific agendas. Namely, advertisements distributed on closed platforms originate from the platform's brand itself. Popular examples include Promoted Tweets on Twitter, Sponsored Stories on Facebook, and TrueView Video Ads on YouTube . [ citation needed ] Open platforms are defined by the promotion of the same piece of branded content across multiple platforms ubiquitously, but through some variation of native ad formats. Unlike closed platforms, the content itself lives outside any given website that it appears on, and is usually distributed across multiple sites by a third party company, meaning that the advertisements appearing on open platforms namely are placed there by an advertiser. [ 31 ] Two prominent platforms that use this open model are Taboola and Outbrain. [ citation needed ] Hybrid platforms allow the content publishing platforms to install a private marketplace where advertisers have the option to bid on the inventory of ad space either through direct sales or programmatic auction through what is known as Real-Time Bidding (RTB). Therefore, advertisements distributed on hybrid platforms are placed there by the platform itself, the space having been sold to an open platform advertiser.

This strategy of presenting editorial content that is paid for by a third party goes by many other names: sponsored content, partner content, advertorials, and branded journalism, to name a few. However, the term native advertising appears to have become the most widely used name for this practice, perhaps in part because its two words most clearly convey its inclusion criteria: first, that the format of the message in some way matches, or is \"native\" to, the format of nonpaid content presented by the same publisher and, second, that the content of such messages is paid advertising. ^ Pardun, Carol J.; Barnes, Beth E.; Broyles, Sheri J.

For a model of external reality as modeled in the mind, see mental model . A cognitive model is a representation of one or more cognitive processes in humans or other animals for the purposes of comprehension and prediction. There are many types of cognitive models , and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard). [ 1 ] [ page needed ] In terms of information processing , cognitive modeling is modeling of human perception, reasoning, memory and action. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Relationship to cognitive architectures [ edit ] Cognitive models can be developed within or without a cognitive architecture , though the two are not always easily distinguishable. In contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g., list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g., visual search and decision making), or making behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g., how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. [ 4 ] Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include ACT-R , Clarion , LIDA , and Soar . History [ edit ] Cognitive modeling historically developed within cognitive psychology / cognitive science (including human factors ), and has received contributions from the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence among others. Box-and-arrow models [ edit ] A number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception or production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child's background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task. In this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information- processing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, & Cohen- McKenzie, 1998; Stackhouse & Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child's mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child's knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.) Computational models [ edit ] This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( December 2010 ) A computational model is a mathematical model in computational science that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. Computational cognitive models examine cognition and cognitive functions by developing process-based computational models formulated as sets of mathematical equations or computer simulations. [ 5 ] The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments. Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models. Symbolic [ edit ] A symbolic model is expressed in characters, usually non-numeric ones, that require translation before they can be used. Subsymbolic [ edit ] A cognitive model is subsymbolic if it is made by constituent entities that are not representations in their turn, e.g., pixels, sound images as perceived by the ear, signal samples; subsymbolic units in neural networks can be considered particular cases of this category. Hybrid [ edit ] Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations. See more details at hybrid intelligent system . Dynamical systems [ edit ] In the traditional computational approach , representations are viewed as static structures of discrete symbols . Cognition takes place by transforming static symbol structures in discrete , sequential steps. Sensory information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into motor outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle. What is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens continuously and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully capture this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or state space , representing the totality of overall states the system could be in. [ 6 ] The system is distinguished by the fact that a change in any aspect of the system state depends on other aspects of the same or other system states. [ 7 ] A typical dynamical model is formalized by several differential equations that describe how the system's state changes over time. By doing so, the form of the space of possible trajectories and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying mechanisms that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs. Early dynamical systems [ edit ] Associative memory [ edit ] Early work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of Hopfield networks . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] These networks were proposed as a model for associative memory . They represent the neural level of memory , modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state. By letting the network learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with vectors which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for. Language acquisition [ edit ] By taking into account the evolutionary development of the human nervous system and the similarity of the brain to other organs, Elman proposed that language and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor. [ 10 ] Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as Elman networks . Instead of treating language as a collection of static lexical items and grammar rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the lexicon as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of attractors and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model. [ 11 ] Cognitive development [ edit ] A classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems: [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The A-not-B error is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy's location that changes over time. The child's past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child's past actions is changing over time. [ 13 ] Locomotion [ edit ] One proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs). By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron central pattern generator (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking. [ 14 ] This CPG contains three motor neurons to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate torque in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either off or on most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out. Modern dynamical systems [ edit ] Behavioral dynamics [ edit ] Modern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”, [ 15 ] treats the agent and the environment as a pair of coupled dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory. In this formalization, the information from the environment informs the agent's behavior and the agent's actions modify the environment. In the specific case of perception-action cycles , the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two functions . The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment. The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent's receptors that reflect the environment's current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions. Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent's nervous systems, the agent's body, and the environment are coupled together [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Adaptive behaviors [ edit ] Behavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior. [ 15 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment. According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis. At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment. Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction. At the second level of time evolution, behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior. In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment. Open dynamical systems [ edit ] In an extension of classical dynamical systems theory , [ 20 ] rather than coupling the environment's and the agent's dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems. The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent's intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent's dynamics in the absence of an environment). Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent's total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent's behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment. This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system. Embodied cognition [ edit ] In the context of dynamical systems and embodied cognition , representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators. In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object. In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior. The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples: [ 21 ] Instances where the environment and agent must work together to achieve a goal, referred to as \"intimacy\". A classic example of intimacy is the behavior of simple agents working to achieve a goal (e.g., insects traversing the environment). The successful completion of the goal relies fully on the coupling of the agent to the environment. [ 22 ] Instances where the use of external artifacts improves the performance of tasks relative to performance without these artifacts. The process is referred to as \"offloading\". A classic example of offloading is the behavior of Scrabble players; people are able to create more words when playing Scrabble if they have the tiles in front of them and are allowed to physically manipulate their arrangement. In this example, the Scrabble tiles allow the agent to offload working memory demands on to the tiles themselves. [ 23 ] Instances where a functionally equivalent external artifact replaces functions that are normally performed internally by the agent, which is a special case of offloading. One famous example is that of human (specifically the agents Otto and Inga) navigation in a complex environment with or without assistance of an artifact. [ 24 ] Instances where there is not a single agent. The individual agent is part of larger system that contains multiple agents and multiple artifacts. One famous example, formulated by Ed Hutchins in his book Cognition in the Wild , is that of navigating a naval ship. [ 25 ] The interpretations of these examples rely on the following logic : (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent's intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes. These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems. Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.

This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages. The account 34.68.0.0/16 has been blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s): Why you are seeing this message: Your current IP address is blocked from editing Wikipedia because it appears to belong to a VPN or proxy service . These types of services are commonly used for abusive editing and circumventing Wikipedia policies, so Wikipedia blocks them as a preventive measure — even if you personally haven't done anything wrong. How to fix it: Turn off VPNs, proxies, or tools like iCloud Private Relay (for Apple users) or Microsoft Edge Secure Network . This is the most frequent reason users encounter this block. Try a different connection. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or use a home network instead of a public or work one. Whitelist Wikipedia. You may be able to whitelist Wikipedia from your VPN so that connections to Wikipedia aren't through a VPN service. Instructions for whitelisting Wikipedia on iCloud Private Relay can be found here . Still blocked? If you believe you are not running an anonymizing proxy or Tor, you should consider checking the configuration to make sure it is accurate. Sometimes the configuration for your network is changed without your knowledge, sometimes by malware. In truly exceptional circumstances, you may request IP block exemption . Approval is limited and based on specific criteria, and you should only request it if you have no other way to edit Wikipedia. Note : These blocks are about the type of internet connection, not your actions. We appreciate good-faith contributors and want to help you get editing again. How to appeal if you are confident that your connection does not use a colocation provider's IP address: If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page : {{ unblock |reason=Caught by a colocation web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. My IP address is _______. Place any further information here. ~~~~}} . You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here . Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system . There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. Information for administrators: Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests . Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator. This block will expire on 17:40, 25 September 2027. Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page , as well as email administrators and other editors.

[ 1 ] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name . The term \"web page\" is therefore a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book. Navigation [ edit ] Main article: Web navigation Each article on the Wikipedia website is a distinct web page. The URL is visible in the browser's address bar at the top. Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser , the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user's screen. [ 2 ] If the user clicks or taps a link , the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has features , such as the address bar , that indicate which page is displayed. Elements [ edit ] A web page is a structured document . The core element is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This specifies the content of the page, [ 3 ] including images and video . Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of the page. [ 3 ] CSS rules can be in separate text files or embedded within the HTML file. The vast majority [ 4 ] of pages have JavaScript programs , enabling a wide range of behavior. [ 3 ] The newer WebAssembly language can also be used as a supplement . [ 5 ] The most sophisticated web pages, known as web apps , combine these elements in a complex manner . Deployment [ edit ] From the perspective of server-side website deployment, there are two types of web pages: static and dynamic . Static pages are retrieved from the web server's file system without any modification, [ 6 ] while dynamic pages must be created by the server on the fly , typically reading from a database to fill out a template , before being sent to the user's browser. [ 7 ] An example of a dynamic page is a search engine results page .

Notable customers include AT&T , Dr. Pepper , Hubspot and TechCrunch . [ 1 ] History [ edit ] Swiftype was founded in 2012 by Matt Riley and Quin Hoxie. [ 2 ] The company participated in Y Combinator ’s incubator program and received investment from a number of prominent sources. [ 3 ] Their site search uses semantic understanding of queries to differentiate the meaning of words based on their use. In September 2013, Swiftype obtained Series A funding from New Enterprise Associates (NEA). [ 4 ] In March 2015, Swiftype raised an additional $13 million in Series B funding led by NEA for a total of $20 million in funding. [ 5 ] They used some of these funds to expand into areas outside of site search, especially for knowledge bases, customer support and e-commerce . Swiftype's site search can be used for faceted search , full text search , real-time search , and concept search queries. The company's plans offer on-demand and live recrawls and indexing of websites. Other features include drag and drop result customization, real-time analytics and adjustable weights. [ 6 ] In an effort to further grow outside of site search, Swiftype introduced an enterprise search service in February 2017. It aimed to help organizations find their data across different services like G Suite , Office 365 , Dropbox , Zendesk and more. [ 7 ] It also offers an API for searching custom data sources. Swiftype also introduced an artificial intelligence that interprets the queries and builds an \"enterprise knowledge graph\" from the data it accesses. Swiftype was acquired by Elastic in November 2017. [ 8 ] Elastic powers Elasticsearch , a tool Swiftype had previously used to index and store their search content. [ 1 ] While the acquisition didn't provide any drastic changes, they did set a new introductory price and work to incorporate some of Elastic's search features into their Enterprise Search. [ 9 ] In May 2018, Swiftype introduced Elastic App Search Service, a new search product for developers.

The update was aimed at decreasing search engine rankings of websites that violate Google's Webmaster Guidelines [ 2 ] by using now declared Grey Hat SEM techniques involved in increasing artificially the ranking of a webpage by manipulating the number of links pointing to the page. Such tactics are commonly described as link schemes. [ 3 ] According to Google's John Mueller, [ 1 ] as of 2013, Google announced all updates to the Penguin filter to the public. [ 4 ] Effect on search results [ edit ] By Google's estimates, [ 5 ] Penguin affected approximately 3.1% of search queries in English , about 3% of queries in languages like German , Chinese , and Arabic , and an even greater percentage of them in \"highly spammed\" languages. On May 25, 2012, Google unveiled another Penguin update, called Penguin 1.1. This update, according to Matt Cutts , former head of webspam at Google, was supposed to affect less than one-tenth of a percent of English searches. The guiding principle for the update was to penalize websites that were using manipulative techniques to achieve high rankings. Pre-Penguin sites commonly used negative link building techniques to rank highly and get traffic. Once Penguin was rolled out, it meant that content was key, and those with great content would be recognised and those with little or spammy content would be penalised and receive no ranking benefits. [ 6 ] The purpose according to Google was to catch excessive spammers. Allegedly, few websites lost search rankings on Google for specific keywords during the Panda and Penguin rollouts. [ 7 ] Google specifically mentions that doorway pages , which are only built to attract search engine traffic, are against their webmaster guidelines. In January 2012, the so-called Page Layout Algorithm Update [ 8 ] (also known as the Top Heavy Update) [ 9 ] was released, which targeted websites with too many ads, or too little content above the fold . Penguin 3 was released October 5, 2012, and affected 0.3% of queries. [ 10 ] Penguin 4 (also known as Penguin 2.0) was released on May 22, 2013, and affected 2.3% of queries. [ 11 ] Penguin 5 (also known as Penguin 2.1) [ 12 ] was released on October 4, 2013, affected around 1% of queries, and has been the most recent of the Google Penguin algorithm updates. [ 13 ] Google was reported to have released Penguin 3.0 on October 18, 2014. [ 14 ] On October 21, 2014, Google's Pierre Farr confirmed that Penguin 3.0 was an algorithm \"refresh\", with no new signals added. [ 15 ] On April 7, 2015, Google's John Mueller said in a Google+ hangout that both Penguin and Panda \"currently are not updating the data regularly\" and that updates must be pushed out manually. This confirms that the algorithm is not updated continuously which was believed to be the case earlier on in the year. [ 16 ] The strategic goal that Panda, Penguin, and the page layout update share is to display higher quality websites at the top of Google's search results . However, sites that were downranked as the result of these updates have different sets of characteristics. The main target of Google Penguin is to focus on The so-called \"black-hat\" link-building strategies, such as link buying, link farming, automated links, PBNs, and others. [ 17 ] In a Google+ Hangout on April 15, 2016, John Mueller said \"I am pretty sure when we start rolling out [Penguin] we will have a message to kind of post but at the moment I don't have anything specific to kind of announce.\" [ 18 ] Penguin 4.0 (7th Penguin update) [ edit ] On September 23, 2016 Google announced that Google Penguin was now part of the core algorithm [ 19 ] meaning that it updates in real time. Hence there will no longer be announcements by Google relating to future refreshes. [ 20 ] Real-time also means that websites are evaluated in real-time and rankings impacted in real-time. During the last years webmasters instead always had to wait for the roll-out of the next update to get out of a Penguin penalty. Also, Google Penguin 4.0 is more granular as opposed to previous updates, since it may affect a website on a URL-basis as opposed to always affecting a whole website. Finally, Penguin 4.0 [ 21 ] [ 22 ] differs from previous Penguin versions since it does not demote a web site when it finds bad links. Instead it discounts the links, meaning it ignores them and they no longer count toward the website's ranking. As a result of this, there is less need to use the disavow file. [ 21 ] Google uses both algorithm and human reviewers to identify links that are unnatural (artificial), manipulative or deceptive and includes these in its Manual Actions report for websites. [ 23 ] Google's Penguin feedback form [ edit ] Two days after the Penguin update was released Google prepared a feedback form, [ 24 ] designed for two categories of users: those who want to report web spam that still ranks highly after the search algorithm change, and those who think that their site got unfairly hit by the update. Google also has a reconsideration form through Google Webmaster Tools. In January 2015, Google's John Mueller said that a Penguin penalty can be removed by simply building good links. The usual process is to remove bad links manually or by using Google's Disavow tool and then filing a reconsideration request. [ 25 ] Mueller elaborated on this by saying the algorithm looks at the percentage of good links versus bad links, so by building more good links it may tip the algorithm in your favor which would lead to recovery. [ 26 ] Confirmed Penguin updates [ edit ] Penguin 1 on April 24, 2012 (impacting around 3.1% of queries) [ 27 ] Penguin 2 on May 26, 2012 (impacting less than 0.1%) [ 28 ] Penguin 3 on October 5, 2012 (impacting around 0.3% of queries) [ 29 ] Penguin 4 (also known as Penguin 2.0) on May 22, 2013 (impacting 2.3% of queries) [ 30 ] Penguin 5 (also known as Penguin 2.1) on October 4, 2013 (impacting around 1% of queries) [ 31 ] Penguin 6 (also known as Penguin 3.0) on October 17, 2014 (impacting less than 1% English queries). [ 32 ] On December 1, 2014 Google confirmed that the update was still rolling out with webmasters continuing to report significant fluctuations.

For the use of ISBNs on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:ISBN . International Standard Book Number A 13-digit ISBN, 978-3-16-148410-0, as represented by an EAN-13 bar code Acronym ISBN Organisation International ISBN Agency Introduced 1970 ; 55 years ago ( 1970 ) [ 1 ] No. of digits 13 (formerly 10) Check digit Weighted sum Example 978-3-16-148410-0 Website isbn-international .org The International Standard Book Number ( ISBN ) is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique. [ a ] [ b ] Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency. [ 2 ] A different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication, but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item. For example, an e-book , a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007. [ c ] The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country. The first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering ( SBN ) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero). Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative. [ 4 ] A separate identifier code of a similar kind, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers . The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores . History The Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books. [ 1 ] They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by Gordon Foster , emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin . [ 5 ] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker [ 6 ] [ 7 ] (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") [ 8 ] and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay [ 6 ] (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker ). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. [ 1 ] [ 6 ] The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9 . The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978. [ 11 ] Total number of ISBN registrations. 2020. An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns , published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\" , where \"340\" indicates the publisher , \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit . By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8 ; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books , would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book; [ 12 ] for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8), [ 13 ] and it cost US$5.95 . [ 14 ] Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with \" Bookland \" European Article Numbers , which have 13 digits. [ 3 ] Since 2016, ISBNs have also been used to identify mobile games by China's Administration of Press and Publication . [ 15 ] The United States , with 3.9 million registered ISBNs in 2020, was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in 2020, followed by the Republic of Korea (329,582), Germany (284,000), China (263,066), the UK (188,553) and Indonesia (144,793). Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over 39 million as of 2020. [ 16 ] Overview A separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, audiobook , paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it. [ 17 ] : 12 The ISBN of an electronic publication is often colloquially called \" eISBN \", [ 18 ] [ 19 ] however no such notation is present in the documentation. Whether a publication is electronic or print cannot be inferred from the ISBN only. The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007. [ c ] [ 3 ] An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN). Section 5 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual [ 17 ] : 11 describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows: The parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN‑13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN‑13 labeled \"EAN\" is the Bookland country code. for a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a GS1 prefix : so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1, the registration group element (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory), [ d ] the registrant element, the publication element , and a checksum character or check digit . A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts ( prefix element , registration group , registrant , publication and check digit ), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts ( registration group , registrant , publication and check digit ) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits. [ e ] Online tools such the ISBN Converter provided by the Library of Congress and ISBNBarcode.org can assist with hyphenation and generate standard barcodes. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Issuing process ISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded. [ 23 ] A full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website. [ 24 ] A list for a few countries is given below: Australia – Thorpe-Bowker [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Brazil – The National Library of Brazil ; [ 27 ] (Up to 28 February 2020) [ 28 ] Brazil – Câmara Brasileira do Livro [ 29 ] (From 1 March 2020) [ 28 ] Canada – English Library and Archives Canada , a government agency; French Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec ; Caribbean Community (CARICOM) secretariat [ 30 ] [ 31 ] maintains a shared ISBN of '976' for several member states of the Caribbean region. Colombia – Cámara Colombiana del Libro, an NGO Hong Kong – Books Registration Office (BRO), under the Hong Kong Public Libraries [ 32 ] Iceland – Landsbókasafn ( National and University Library of Iceland ) India – The Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN (Book Promotion and Copyright Division), under Department of Higher Education, a constituent of the Ministry of Human Resource Development [ 33 ] Israel – The Israel Center for Libraries [ 34 ] Italy – EDISER srl , owned by Associazione Italiana Editori (Italian Publishers Association) [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Kenya – National Library of Kenya Latvia - Latvian ISBN Agency Lebanon – Lebanese ISBN Agency Maldives – The National Bureau of Classification (NBC) Malta – The National Book Council (Maltese: Il-Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb ) [ 37 ] [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Morocco – The National Library of Morocco New Zealand – The National Library of New Zealand [ 40 ] Nigeria – National Library of Nigeria Pakistan – National Library of Pakistan Philippines – National Library of the Philippines [ 41 ] South Africa – National Library of South Africa Spain – Spanish ISBN Agency – Agencia del ISBN Turkey – General Directorate of Libraries and Publications, a branch of the Ministry of Culture [ 42 ] United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland – Nielsen Book Services Ltd , part of NIQ [ 43 ] United States – R. R. Bowker [ 6 ] [ 44 ] Registration group element The ISBN registration group element is a 1-to-5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979), [ 17 ] : 11 and can be separated between hyphens, such as \"978-1-...\" . Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element - many inherited from the 10 digit ISBN. [ 45 ] The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. Example 5-digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0–5, 600–631, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9910–9989, and 99901–99993. [ 46 ] Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements. [ 47 ] Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. [ 48 ] The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy. [ 49 ] The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN. Registrant element The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element ( cf. Category:ISBN agencies ) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] The International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers . [ 53 ] This database is freely searchable over the internet. Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers. By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. [ 54 ] Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.

These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows: [ 20 ] Publication element length 0 – Registration group element 1 – Registration group element Total Registrants From To Registrants From To Registrants 6 digits 0-00-xxxxxx-x 0-19-xxxxxx-x 20 1-01-xxxxxx-x 1-05-xxxxxx-x 1-02-xxxxxx-x 1-05-xxxxxx-x 3 23 5 digits 0-200-xxxxx-x 0-229-xxxxx-x 0-370-xxxxx-x 0-640-xxxxx-x 0-646-xxxxx-x 0-649-xxxxx-x 0-656-xxxxx-x 0-227-xxxxx-x 0-368-xxxxx-x 0-638-xxxxx-x 0-644-xxxxx-x 0-647-xxxxx-x 0-654-xxxxx-x 0-699-xxxxx-x 494 1-000-xxxxx-x 1-030-xxxxx-x 1-040-xxxxx-x 1-100-xxxxx-x 1-714-xxxxx-x 1-009-xxxxx-x 1-034-xxxxx-x 1-049-xxxxx-x 1-397-xxxxx-x 1-716-xxxxx-x 326 820 4 digits 0-2280-xxxx-x 0-3690-xxxx-x 0-6390-xxxx-x 0-6550-xxxx-x 0-7000-xxxx-x 0-2289-xxxx-x 0-3699-xxxx-x 0-6397-xxxx-x 0-6559-xxxx-x 0-8499-xxxx-x 1,538 1-0350-xxxx-x 1-0700-xxxx-x 1-3980-xxxx-x 1-6500-xxxx-x 1-6860-xxxx-x 1-7170-xxxx-x 1-7620-xxxx-x 1-7900-xxxx-x 1-8672-xxxx-x 1-9730-xxxx-x 1-0399-xxxx-x 1-0999-xxxx-x 1-5499-xxxx-x 1-6799-xxxx-x 1-7139-xxxx-x 1-7319-xxxx-x 1-7634-xxxx-x 1-7999-xxxx-x 1-8675-xxxx-x 1-9877-xxxx-x 2,867 4,405 3 digits 0-85000-xxx-x 0-89999-xxx-x 5,000 1-55000-xxx-x 1-68000-xxx-x 1-74000-xxx-x 1-76500-xxx-x 1-77540-xxx-x 1-77650-xxx-x 1-77830-xxx-x 1-80000-xxx-x 1-83850-xxx-x 1-86760-xxx-x 1-64999-xxx-x 1-68599-xxx-x 1-76199-xxx-x 1-77499-xxx-x 1-77639-xxx-x 1-77699-xxx-x 1-78999-xxx-x 1-83799-xxx-x 1-86719-xxx-x 1-86979-xxx-x 22,010 27,010 2 digits 0-900000-xx-x 0-900372-xx-x 0-900370-xx-x 0-949999-xx-x 49,999 1-869800-xx-x 1-916506-xx-x 1-916908-xx-x 1-919565-xx-x 1-919655-xx-x 1-987800-xx-x 1-991200-xx-x 1-915999-xx-x 1-916869-xx-x 1-919163-xx-x 1-919599-xx-x 1-972999-xx-x 1-991149-xx-x 1-998989-xx-x 113,340 163,339 1 digit 0-6398000-x-x 0-6450000-x-x 0-6480000-x-x 0-9003710-x-x 0-9500000-x-x 0-6399999-x-x 0-6459999-x-x 0-6489999-x-x 0-9003719-x-x 0-9999999-x-x 522,010 1-0670000-x-x 1-7320000-x-x 1-7635000-x-x 1-7750000-x-x 1-7764000-x-x 1-7770000-x-x 1-8380000-x-x 1-9160000-x-x 1-9168700-x-x 1-9191640-x-x 1-9196000-x-x 1-9911500-x-x 1-9989900-x-x 1-0699999-x-x 1-7399999-x-x 1-7649999-x-x 1-7753999-x-x 1-7764999-x-x 1-7782999-x-x 1-8384999-x-x 1-9165059-x-x 1-9169079-x-x 1-9195649-x-x 1-9196549-x-x 1-9911999-x-x 1-9999999-x-x 168,600 690,610 Total 579,061 Total 307,146 886,207 Check digits A check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection , the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit . It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an 'X'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain the letter 'X'. ISBN-10 check digits According to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual, [ 55 ] the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol 'X' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if x i is the i th digit, then x 10 must be chosen such that: ∑ i = 1 10 ( 11 − i ) x i ≡ 0 ( mod 11 ) . {\\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^{10}(11-i)x_{i}\\equiv 0{\\pmod {11}}.} For example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2: s = ( 0 × 10 ) + ( 3 × 9 ) + ( 0 × 8 ) + ( 6 × 7 ) + ( 4 × 6 ) + ( 0 × 5 ) + ( 6 × 4 ) + ( 1 × 3 ) + ( 5 × 2 ) + ( 2 × 1 ) = 0 + 27 + 0 + 42 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 3 + 10 + 2 = 132 = 12 × 11. {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2)+(2\\times 1)\\\\&=0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10+2\\\\&=132=12\\times 11.\\end{aligned}}} Formally, using modular arithmetic , this is rendered ( 10 x 1 + 9 x 2 + 8 x 3 + 7 x 4 + 6 x 5 + 5 x 6 + 4 x 7 + 3 x 8 + 2 x 9 + x 10 ) ≡ 0 ( mod 11 ) . {\\displaystyle (10x_{1}+9x_{2}+8x_{3}+7x_{4}+6x_{5}+5x_{6}+4x_{7}+3x_{8}+2x_{9}+x_{10})\\equiv 0{\\pmod {11}}.} It is also true for ISBN 10s that the sum of all ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example: s = ( 0 × 1 ) + ( 3 × 2 ) + ( 0 × 3 ) + ( 6 × 4 ) + ( 4 × 5 ) + ( 0 × 6 ) + ( 6 × 7 ) + ( 1 × 8 ) + ( 5 × 9 ) + ( 2 × 10 ) = 0 + 6 + 0 + 24 + 20 + 0 + 42 + 8 + 45 + 20 = 165 = 15 × 11. {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(0\\times 1)+(3\\times 2)+(0\\times 3)+(6\\times 4)+(4\\times 5)+(0\\times 6)+(6\\times 7)+(1\\times 8)+(5\\times 9)+(2\\times 10)\\\\&=0+6+0+24+20+0+42+8+45+20\\\\&=165=15\\times 11.\\end{aligned}}} Formally, this is rendered ( x 1 + 2 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 4 x 4 + 5 x 5 + 6 x 6 + 7 x 7 + 8 x 8 + 9 x 9 + 10 x 10 ) ≡ 0 ( mod 11 ) . {\\displaystyle (x_{1}+2x_{2}+3x_{3}+4x_{4}+5x_{5}+6x_{6}+7x_{7}+8x_{8}+9x_{9}+10x_{10})\\equiv 0{\\pmod {11}}.} The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g. when typing it or writing it down) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN 10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN 10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits (these proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number ). The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN—the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN. [ 56 ] In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely). ISBN-10 check digit calculation Each of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11. For example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615- ? is calculated as follows: s = ( 0 × 10 ) + ( 3 × 9 ) + ( 0 × 8 ) + ( 6 × 7 ) + ( 4 × 6 ) + ( 0 × 5 ) + ( 6 × 4 ) + ( 1 × 3 ) + ( 5 × 2 ) = 130. {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2)\\\\&=130.\\end{aligned}}} Adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12×11)—this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of x 10 {\\displaystyle x_{10}} required to satisfy this condition is 10, then an 'X' should be used. Alternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11 − 0 = 11 , which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the first \"modulo 11\" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.) For example, the check digit for the ISBN of 0-306-40615- ? is calculated as follows: s = ( 11 − ( ( ( 0 × 10 ) + ( 3 × 9 ) + ( 0 × 8 ) + ( 6 × 7 ) + ( 4 × 6 ) + ( 0 × 5 ) + ( 6 × 4 ) + ( 1 × 3 ) + ( 5 × 2 ) ) mod 11 ) ) mod 11 = ( 11 − ( ( 0 + 27 + 0 + 42 + 24 + 0 + 24 + 3 + 10 ) mod 11 ) ) mod 11 = ( 11 − ( ( 130 ) mod 11 ) ) mod 11 = ( 11 − ( 9 ) ) mod 11 = 2 mod 11 = 2 {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(11-(((0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-((0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10)\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-((130)\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-(9))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=2\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=2\\end{aligned}}} Thus the check digit is 2. It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples: // Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one. // digits[i] must be between 0 and 10. int CheckISBN ( int const digits [ 10 ]) { int i , s = 0 , t = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++ i ) { t += digits [ i ]; s += t ; } return s % 11 ; } The modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition. ISBN-13 check digit calculation Appendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual [ 17 ] : 33 describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10 . As ISBN-13 is a subset of EAN-13 , the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both. Formally, using modular arithmetic , this is rendered: ( x 1 + 3 x 2 + x 3 + 3 x 4 + x 5 + 3 x 6 + x 7 + 3 x 8 + x 9 + 3 x 10 + x 11 + 3 x 12 + x 13 ) ≡ 0 ( mod 10 ) . {\\displaystyle (x_{1}+3x_{2}+x_{3}+3x_{4}+x_{5}+3x_{6}+x_{7}+3x_{8}+x_{9}+3x_{10}+x_{11}+3x_{12}+x_{13})\\equiv 0{\\pmod {10}}.} The calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten, so, in all cases, a single check digit results. For example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615- ? is calculated as follows: s = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3 = 9 + 21 + 8 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 6 + 12 + 0 + 18 + 1 + 15 = 93 93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3 10 – 3 = 7 Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7. In general, the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows. Let r = 10 − ( ( x 1 + 3 x 2 + x 3 + 3 x 4 + ⋯ + x 11 + 3 x 12 ) mod 1 0 ) . {\\displaystyle r=10-{\\big (}{\\big (}x_{1}+3x_{2}+x_{3}+3x_{4}+\\cdots +x_{11}+3x_{12}{\\big )}{\\bmod {1}}0{\\big )}.} Then x 13 = { r , r < 10 , 0 , r = 10. {\\displaystyle x_{13}={\\begin{cases}r,&r<10,\\\\0,&r=10.\\end{cases}}} This check system—similar to the UPC check digit formula—does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3 × 6 + 1 × 1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3 × 1 + 1 × 6 = 9 . However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0–9 to express the check digit. Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0). ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion A 10-digit ISBN is converted to a 13-digit ISBN by prepending \"978\" to the ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent. Errors in usage Publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. [ 57 ] For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books— Ninja gaiden: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic . Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". [ 58 ] The International Union Library Catalog ( WorldCat OCLC —Online Computer Library Center system) often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library. [ 59 ] EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading The barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13 ; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price . [ 60 ] For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1× and 3× weighting on alternating digits). Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007. [ 61 ] As of 2011 [update] , all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN . The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero, and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0, while 979-1 to 979-9 are used for ISBN, 979-8- used for USA. Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range. [ 62 ] Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble ) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN in North America.

Conversely, the same book can be published with several ISBNs: A German second-language edition of Emil und die Detektive has the ISBNs 87-23-90157-8 (Denmark), 0-8219-1069-8 (United States), 91-21-15628-X (Sweden), 0-85048-548-7 (United Kingdom) and 3-12-675495-3 (Germany). ^ In some cases, books sold only as a set share the same ISBN. For example, the Vance Integral Edition used only two ISBNs for 44 books. ^ a b Publishers were required to convert existing ISBNs from the 10-digit format to the 13-digit format (in their publication records) by 1 January 2007. For existing publications, the new 13-digit ISBN would only need to be added if (and when) a publication was reprinted. During the transition period, publishers were recommended to print both the 10-digit and 13-digit ISBNs on the verso of a publication's title page, but they were required to print only the 13-digit ISBN after 1 January 2007. [ 3 ] ^ Some books have several codes in the first block: e.g. A. M. Yaglom's Correlation Theory... , published by Springer Verlag , has two ISBNs, 0-387-96331-6 and 3-540-96331-6 . Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit for both (6). Springer uses 431 as the publisher code for Japanese (4), and 4-431-96331-? also has a check digit of 6. Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also have a check digit of 6. This suggests that special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would not be expected to lead by coincidence to the same check digit every time for the same item number. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect would amount to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic. [ original research? ] ^ The International ISBN Agency's ISBN User's Manual says: \"The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces\", although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed. [ 20 ] The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages. References ^ a b c \"ISBN History\" . isbn.org. 20 April 2014. Archived from the original on 20 April 2014 .

Smith Lecture (2003) Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award (2007) Scientific career Thesis An algorithm for translating chemical names to molecular formulas (1961) Website Archived: Garfield Library Eugene Eli Garfield (September 16, 1925 – February 26, 2017) [ 2 ] [ 3 ] was an American linguist and businessman, one of the founders of bibliometrics and scientometrics . [ 4 ] He helped to create Current Contents , Science Citation Index (SCI), Journal Citation Reports , and Index Chemicus , among others, and founded the magazine The Scientist . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Early life and education [ edit ] Garfield was born in 1925 in New York City as Eugene Eli Garfinkle, [ 2 ] his mother being of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] His parents were second generation immigrants living in East Bronx in New York City. [ 11 ] He studied at the University of Colorado and University of California, Berkeley before getting a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1949. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Garfield also received a degree in Library Science from Columbia University in 1953. [ 11 ] [ 14 ] He went on to do his PhD in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania , which he completed in 1961 for developing an algorithm for translating chemical nomenclature into chemical formulas . [ 1 ] [ 15 ] Career and research [ edit ] Working as a laboratory assistant at Columbia University after his graduation, Garfield indexed all previously synthesized compounds so that not to remake them, which helped him understand that his inclination to information towards science was bigger than towards chemistry. In 1951, he got a position at the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where most of the National Library of Medicine information systems were developed. There he built search and cataloging system methods using punch-cards . In 1953, at the First Symposium on Machine Methods in Scientific Documentation, Garfield got introduced to Shepard's Citations . [ 11 ] In 1960, Garfield founded the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) , which was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [ 16 ] In the 1990s, ISI was faced with bankruptcy and was acquired by JPT Holdings who later sold it to Thomson (Thomas Business Information) where it formed a major part of the science division of Thomson Reuters . In October 2016 Thomson Reuters completed the sale of its intellectual property and science division; it is now known as Clarivate Analytics . [ 17 ] Garfield was responsible for many innovative bibliographic products, including Current Contents , the Science Citation Index (SCI), and other citation databases, the Journal Citation Reports , and Index Chemicus . He was the founding editor and publisher of The Scientist , a news magazine for life scientists. [ 11 ] In 2003, the University of South Florida School of Information was honored to have him as lecturer for the Alice G. Smith Lecture . In 2007, he launched Histcite , a bibliometric analysis and visualization software package. Following ideas inspired by Vannevar Bush 's highly cited 1945 article As We May Think , Garfield undertook the development of a comprehensive citation index showing the propagation of scientific thinking; he started the Institute for Scientific Information in 1956 (it was sold to the Thomson Corporation in 1992 [ 18 ] ). According to Garfield, \"the citation index ... may help a historian to measure the influence of an article — that is, its 'impact factor'\". [ 19 ] The creation of the Science Citation Index made it possible to calculate impact factor , [ 20 ] which ostensibly measures the importance of scientific journals. It led to the unexpected discovery that a few journals like Nature and Science were core for all of hard science . The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] His entrepreneurial flair in having turned what was, at least at the time, an obscure and specialist metric into a highly profitable business has been noted. [ 23 ] A scientometric analysis of his top fifty cited papers has been conducted. [ 24 ] Garfield's work led to the development of several information retrieval algorithms, like the HITS algorithm and PageRank . Both use the structured citation between websites through hyperlinks. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin acknowledged Garfield in their development of PageRank, the algorithm that powers their company's search engine. [ 23 ] Garfield published over 1,000 essays. Honors and awards [ edit ] Garfield was honored with the Award of Merit from the Association for Information Science and Technology in 1975. He was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1984, [ 16 ] the Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal in 1984, [ 25 ] and the Miles Conrad Award in 1985. [ 26 ] He was also awarded the Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award in 2007. [ 27 ] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society that same year. [ 28 ] The Association for Library and Information Science Education has a fund for doctoral research through an award named after Garfield. Criticism [ edit ] Writing in Physiology News , No. 69, Winter 2007, David Colquhoun of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London , described the \" impact factor ,\" a method for comparing scholarly journals, as \"the invention of Eugene Garfield, a man who has done enormous harm to true science.\" Colquhoun ridiculed C. Hoeffel's assertion that Garfield's impact factor \"has the advantage of already being in existence and is, therefore, a good technique for scientific evaluation\" by saying, \"you can't get much dumber than that.

The main purpose of digital display advertising is to post company ads on third-party websites. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] A display ad is usually interactive (i.e. clickable), which allows brands and advertisers to engage deeper with the users. A display ad can also be a companion ad for a non-clickable video ad . According to eMarketer , Facebook and Twitter were set to take 33 percent of display ad spending market share by 2017. [ 4 ] Desktop display advertising eclipsed search ad buying in 2014, with mobile ad spending overtaking display in 2015. [ 5 ] Overview [ edit ] Digital display advertising is an online form of advertising in which the company's promotional messages appear on third-party sites or search engine results pages such as publishers or social networks. There is an evidence showing that this advertising can increase the number of website page view of a company from most types of customers except from the non-authenticated visitors who visited the website before. [ 6 ] The main purpose of display advertising is to support brand awareness (Robinson et al., 2007) [ 7 ] and it also helps to increase the purchase intention of consumers. Social media is used by many organizations. One example is, in 2014, ASOS and Nike collaborated with Google Hangouts to create the first shoppable video web chat [ 8 ] on Google+ . The video is an example of display advertising used for commemorating 27 years of Nike's Air Max shoes. The video advertising aimed at creating brand awareness among users and convincing them to watch the Hangout and purchase products from the display advertising itself. Consumers were able to shop by clicking the display advertising. According to an ASOS statement, display advertising has contributed to an increase in both the number of users visiting its website and downloads of the ASOS App by 28 percent, with users having then visited the website eight times a month, on average. [ 9 ] History [ edit ] Since the early advent of technology, the Internet has completely changed the way people relate to advertisements. As computers prices decreased, online content became accessible to a large portion of the world's population. [ 3 ] This change has modified the way people are exposed to media and advertising and has led to the creation of online channels through which advertisements can reach users. [ 10 ] The first type of relationship between a website and an advertiser was a straightforward, direct partnership. This partnership model implies that the advertiser promoting a product or service pays the website (also known as a publisher) directly for a certain amount of ad impressions. The first digital ad, called a banner ad , was run in 1994 by AT&T on a site called HotWired. [ 11 ] As time went on, publishers began creating thousands of websites, leading to millions of pages with unsold ad space. This gave rise to a new set of companies called Ad Networks . [ 12 ] The ad network acted as a broker, buying unsold ad space from multiple publishers and packaged them into audiences to be sold to advertisers. This second wave of advertiser-publisher relationships rapidly gained popularity as it was convenient and useful for buyers who often found themselves paying a lower price yet receiving enhanced targeting capabilities through ad networks. The third and most recent major development that shaped the advertiser-publisher ecosystem started occurring in the late 2000s when widespread adoption of RTB (real time bidding) technology took place. Also referred to as programmatic bidding, RTB allowed companies representing buyers and sellers to bid on the price to show an ad to a user every time a banner ad is loading. When a page loads during a user visit, there are thousands of bids occurring from advertisers to serve an ad to that user, based on each company's individual algorithms. With this most recent change in the industry, more and more ads are being sold on a single-impression basis, as opposed to in bulk purchases. Programmatic, Real time bidding (RTB) [ edit ] Programmatic display advertising, or real time bidding (RTB) , transformed the way digital display advertising is bought and managed in recent years. Rather than placing a booking for advertising directly with a website, advertisers will manage their activity through a ( demand side platform ), and bid to advertise to people in real time, across multiple websites, based on targeting criteria. This method of advertising quickly gained popularity, as it allows for more control for the advertiser (or agency), including of the individual target audience, rather than just the website. It has become a threat to website operators and generally the cost paid for advertising in this way is less than the old method and so the earning potential for them is reduced. [ citation needed ] Programmatic is not without its drawbacks, as without the appropriate management adverts can appear against unsavoury content or inappropriate news topics. This issue became front-page news in February 2017, [ 13 ] when advertisers on YouTube were found displayed on terror group websites and fake news sites. As a result, a number of major advertisers paused all of their online advertising until they could put the appropriate measures in place to prevent this occurring again. [ 14 ] Other issues can arise from this method of buying display ads, for example since DSPs mostly buy from inventory on the public ad exchanges , the quality of the impressions bought can often be questionable and low value. in response to this, in the past few years we have seen the proliferation and use of private deals through PMPs . First online advertisement [ edit ] The birthday of the first banner display on the World Wide Web was on 27 October 1994. It appeared on HotWired , the first commercial web magazine. [ 15 ] The COCONET online service had graphical online banner ads starting in 1988 in San Diego, California. [ citation needed ] The Prodigy service, launched also in 1988, also had banner ads. [ citation needed ] Operations [ edit ] Accounts department [ edit ] The accounts department meet with the client to define campaign goals and translate those goals into a creative brief to be forwarded to the creative department. Creative department [ edit ] The role of the creative team is to conceptualise and create the advert. They have to develop a creative execution that will be compelling enough to drive a customer to buy a product or a service. The team often consists of a mix of copy writers and graphic designers who use their respective skillsets to communicate via copy and visuals. [ 3 ] Media planner [ edit ] People have to test in which way the user experiences all the information of a data visualization. For this reason, they have to study the users' response to sounds, image, and motion. They have to be aware of everything that is digitally consumed, to know all the newest technologies and media solutions, and to help all the other departments to find the best way to reach the object's campaign. Ad operations [ edit ] Ad Operations, or 'Ad ops', are the people who ensure that the ad is physically delivered to the correct website at the correct time. They do this by uploading the ad into the advertiser's ad server so that it can be delivered to the website and displayed to the end user who will see it. They are also responsible of delivering 100% of the advertiser's budget in an ad campaign by regularly tracking the ad campaign performance and optimizing it towards the advertiser's KPIs. Ad server [ edit ] Ad servers helps manage digital display advertisements. It is an advertising technology (ad tech) tool that, throughout a platform, administrates the ads and their distribution. It is basically a service or technology for a company that takes care of all the ad campaign programs and by receiving the ad files it is able to allocate them in different websites. [ 3 ] The ad server is responsible for things such as the dates by which the campaign has to run on a website; the rapidity in which an ad as to be spread and where (geographic location targeting, language targeting.. ); controlling that an ad is not overseen by a user by limiting the number of visualisations; proposing an ad on past behaviour targeting. There are different types of ad servers. There is an ad server for publishers that helps them to launch a new ad on a website by listing the highest ads' price on its and to follow the ad's growth by registering how many users it has reached. There is an ad server for advertisers that helps them by sending the ads in the form of HTML codes to each publisher. In this way, it is possible to open the ad in every moment and make changes of frequency for example, at all times. Lastly, there is an ad server for ad networks that provides information as in which network the publisher is registering an income and which is the daily revenue. Importance of formats of display ads [ edit ] Two students of the \"Amsterdam school of Communication Research ASCor\" have run studies about the audience reactions to different display advertising formats. In particular, they took into consideration two different types of format (sponsored content and banner advertising) to demonstrate that people react and perceive formats in different ways, positive and negative. [ 16 ] For this reason, it is important to choose the right format because it will help to make the most of the medium. It is also possible to add: Video; Rich Media Ads (Expandables): flash files that may expand when the user interacts on mouseover (polite), or auto- initiated (non-polite); Overlays: ads that appear above content and that are possible to remove by clicking on a close button; Interstitials : Ads that are displayed on web pages before expected content (before the target page is displayed on the user's screen); Sponsorship: including a logo or adding a brand to the design of a website. This can also fall under native advertising , which is an ad that can seem like Editorial, or \"In-Feed\", but has really been paid for by the advertiser [ 3 ] IAB standard ad sizes. This illustration has been reduced in size. See actual sizes . To help to better select the right format for the type of ad, Interactive Advertising Bureau has realized a Display Standard Ad Unit Portfolio that works as a guideline that can be followed by the creatives. The IAB ad sizes as of 2007 are : [ 17 ] Rectangles and Pop-Ups [ a ] Medium rectangle: 300 x 250 Square pop-up: 250 x 250 Vertical rectangle: 240 x 400 Large rectangle: 336 x 280 Rectangle: 180 x 150 3:1 Rectangle: 300 x 100 [ b ] Pop-Under: 720 x 300 [ b ] Banners and Buttons Full banner: 468 x 60 Half banner: 234 x 60 Micro bar: 88 x 31 Button 1: 120 x 90 Button 2: 120 x 60 Vertical banner: 120 x 240 Square button: 125 x 125 Leaderboard: 728 x 90 [ c ] Skyscrapers [ a ] Wide skyscraper: 160 x 600 Skyscraper: 120 x 600 Half-page: 300 x 600 [ d ] Those sizes that are bold above are part of the Universal Ad Package. [ 21 ] Grayed entries were delisted after the update in 2011. [ 22 ] Standard banner ad sizes are constantly evolving due to consumer creative fatigue and banner blindness. Ad companies consistently test performance of ad units to ensure maximum performance for their clients. IAB has updated its guideline bi-annually. In 2015, IAB announced advertising creative guidelines for display & mobile, considering HTML5. [ 23 ] Typical web banner , sized 468×60 pixels. In 2017 IAB also introduced the new guidelines, featuring adjustable ad formats, as well as the guidelines for new digital content experiences such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), social media, mobile video, emoji ad messaging, and 360-degree video ads. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Fixed size ad spec is: [ 27 ] Ad unit Name Fixed Size (px) Billboard 970 x 250 Smartphone Banner 300 x 50、320 x 50 Leaderboard 728 x 90 Super Leaderboard/Pushdown 970 x 90 Portrait 300 x 1050 Skyscraper 160 x 600 Medium Rectangle 300 x 250 120x160 120 x 160 Mobile Phone Interstitial 640 x 1136、750 x 1334、1080 x 1920 Feature Phone Small Banner 120 x 20 Feature Phone Medium Banner 168 x 28 Feature Phone Large Banner 216 x 36 Ad Fatigue or Ads boredom [ edit ] Display advertising Fatigue is the term used to describe the state in which consumers lose their sensitivity to or responsiveness to display advertising as a result of prolonged exposure to them. This may lead to poorer click-through rates (CTR), lower engagement rates, and a general decline in the efficacy of ad campaigns. Digital advertising strategies that largely rely on Re-targeting or repetitive exposure across websites and platforms are more likely to face the issue of display ad fatigue. Most common example of ad fatigue is Youtube Ads, Published by Google Ads Advertisers around the world. Reasons for Fatigue from Display Ads [ edit ] Overexposure: If users see the same advertisements too often, they may grow irritated or stop noticing them altogether. Lack of Variety: Users may become disinterested if they always encounter the same messaging or creatives ads. Inadequate Targeting: Users may become disengaged or uninterested in ads that are not tailored or relevant to them.

Spaces and dashes in the ISBN do not matter. Search for book sources ISBN: Search Wikimedia page containing links to catalogs of libraries, booksellers, and other book sources For assistance, see Help:ISBN . This page links to catalogs of libraries, booksellers, and other book sources where you will be able to search for the book by its International Standard Book Number (ISBN). If you arrived at this page by clicking an ISBN link in a Wikipedia page, you will find the full range of relevant search links for that specific book by scrolling to the find links below. To search for a different book, type that book's individual ISBN into this ISBN search box . Spaces and hyphens in the ISBN do not matter. Also, the number starts after the colon for \"ISBN-10:\" and \"ISBN-13:\" numbers. An ISBN identifies a specific edition of a book. Any given title may therefore have a number of different ISBNs. See #Find other editions below for finding other editions. An ISBN registration, even one corresponding to a book page on a major book distributor database, is not definite proof that such a book actually exists. A title may have been cancelled or postponed after the ISBN was assigned. Check to see if the book exists or not. The master copy of this page is located at Wikipedia:Book sources .

Google Books and other retail sources below may be helpful if you want to verify citations in Wikipedia articles, because they often let you search an online version of the book for specific words or phrases, or you can browse through the book (although for copyright reasons the entire book is usually not available).

The nofollow relationship was added in an attempt to help combat [[spamdexing]]. As an example, people could previously create many message-board posts with links to their website to artificially inflate their PageRank. With the nofollow value, message-board administrators can modify their code to automatically insert \"rel='nofollow'\" to all hyperlinks in posts, thus preventing PageRank from being affected by those particular posts. This method of avoidance, however, also has various drawbacks, such as reducing the link value of legitimate comments.

For information on Wikipedia disambiguation pages, see Wikipedia:Disambiguation . For other uses, see Disambiguation (disambiguation) . Word-sense disambiguation is the process of identifying which sense of a word is meant in a sentence or other segment of context . In human language processing and cognition , it is usually subconscious. Given that natural language requires reflection of neurological reality, as shaped by the abilities provided by the brain's neural networks , computer science has had a long-term challenge in developing the ability in computers to do natural language processing and machine learning . Many techniques have been researched, including dictionary-based methods that use the knowledge encoded in lexical resources, supervised machine learning methods in which a classifier is trained for each distinct word on a corpus of manually sense-annotated examples, and completely unsupervised methods that cluster occurrences of words, thereby inducing word senses. Among these, supervised learning approaches have been the most successful algorithms to date. Accuracy of current algorithms is difficult to state without a host of caveats. In English, accuracy at the coarse-grained ( homograph ) level is routinely above 90% (as of 2009), with some methods on particular homographs achieving over 96%. On finer-grained sense distinctions, top accuracies from 59.1% to 69.0% have been reported in evaluation exercises (SemEval-2007, Senseval-2), where the baseline accuracy of the simplest possible algorithm of always choosing the most frequent sense was 51.4% and 57%, respectively. Variants [ edit ] Disambiguation requires two strict inputs: a dictionary to specify the senses which are to be disambiguated and a corpus of language data to be disambiguated (in some methods, a training corpus of language examples is also required). WSD task has two variants: \"lexical sample\" (disambiguating the occurrences of a small sample of target words which were previously selected) and \"all words\" task (disambiguation of all the words in a running text). \"All words\" task is generally considered a more realistic form of evaluation, but the corpus is more expensive to produce because human annotators have to read the definitions for each word in the sequence every time they need to make a tagging judgement, rather than once for a block of instances for the same target word. History [ edit ] WSD was first formulated as a distinct computational task during the early days of machine translation in the 1940s, making it one of the oldest problems in computational linguistics. Warren Weaver first introduced the problem in a computational context in his 1949 memorandum on translation. [ 1 ] Later, Bar-Hillel (1960) argued [ 2 ] that WSD could not be solved by \"electronic computer\" because of the need in general to model all world knowledge. In the 1970s, WSD was a subtask of semantic interpretation systems developed within the field of artificial intelligence, starting with Wilks ' preference semantics. However, since WSD systems were at the time largely rule-based and hand-coded they were prone to a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. By the 1980s large-scale lexical resources, such as the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English (OALD), became available: hand-coding was replaced with knowledge automatically extracted from these resources, but disambiguation was still knowledge-based or dictionary-based. In the 1990s, the statistical revolution advanced computational linguistics, and WSD became a paradigm problem on which to apply supervised machine learning techniques. The 2000s saw supervised techniques reach a plateau in accuracy, and so attention has shifted to coarser-grained senses, domain adaptation , semi-supervised and unsupervised corpus-based systems, combinations of different methods, and the return of knowledge-based systems via graph-based methods. Still, supervised systems continue to perform best. Difficulties [ edit ] Differences between dictionaries [ edit ] One problem with word sense disambiguation is deciding what the senses are, as different dictionaries and thesauruses will provide different divisions of words into senses. Some researchers have suggested choosing a particular dictionary, and using its set of senses to deal with this issue. Generally, however, research results using broad distinctions in senses have been much better than those using narrow ones. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Most researchers continue to work on fine-grained WSD. Most research in the field of WSD is performed by using WordNet as a reference sense inventory for English. WordNet is a computational lexicon that encodes concepts as synonym sets (e.g. the concept of car is encoded as { car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar }). Other resources used for disambiguation purposes include Roget's Thesaurus [ 5 ] and Wikipedia . [ 6 ] More recently, BabelNet , a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, has been used for multilingual WSD. [ 7 ] Part-of-speech tagging [ edit ] In any real test, part-of-speech tagging and sense tagging have proven to be very closely related, with each potentially imposing constraints upon the other. The question whether these tasks should be kept together or decoupled is still not unanimously resolved, but recently scientists incline to test these things separately (e.g. in the Senseval/ SemEval competitions parts of speech are provided as input for the text to disambiguate). Both WSD and part-of-speech tagging involve disambiguating or tagging with words. However, algorithms used for one do not tend to work well for the other, mainly because the part of speech of a word is primarily determined by the immediately adjacent one to three words, whereas the sense of a word may be determined by words further away. The success rate for part-of-speech tagging algorithms is at present much higher than that for WSD, state-of-the art being around 96% [ 8 ] accuracy or better, as compared to less than 75% [ citation needed ] accuracy in word sense disambiguation with supervised learning . These figures are typical for English, and may be very different from those for other languages. Inter-judge variance [ edit ] Another problem is inter-judge variance . WSD systems are normally tested by having their results on a task compared against those of a human. However, while it is relatively easy to assign parts of speech to text, training people to tag senses has been proven to be far more difficult. [ 9 ] While users can memorize all of the possible parts of speech a word can take, it is often impossible for individuals to memorize all of the senses a word can take. Moreover, humans do not agree on the task at hand – give a list of senses and sentences, and humans will not always agree on which word belongs in which sense. [ 10 ] As human performance serves as the standard, it is an upper bound for computer performance. Human performance, however, is much better on coarse-grained than fine-grained distinctions, so this again is why research on coarse-grained distinctions [ 11 ] [ 12 ] has been put to test in recent WSD evaluation exercises. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Sense inventory and algorithms' task-dependency [ edit ] A task-independent sense inventory is not a coherent concept: [ 13 ] each task requires its own division of word meaning into senses relevant to the task. Additionally, completely different algorithms might be required by different applications. In machine translation, the problem takes the form of target word selection. The \"senses\" are words in the target language, which often correspond to significant meaning distinctions in the source language (\"bank\" could translate to the French banque – that is, 'financial bank' or rive – that is, 'edge of river'). In information retrieval, a sense inventory is not necessarily required, because it is enough to know that a word is used in the same sense in the query and a retrieved document; what sense that is, is unimportant. Discreteness of senses [ edit ] Finally, the very notion of \" word sense \" is slippery and controversial. Most people can agree in distinctions at the coarse-grained homograph level (e.g., pen as writing instrument or enclosure), but go down one level to fine-grained polysemy , and disagreements arise. For example, in Senseval-2, which used fine-grained sense distinctions, human annotators agreed in only 85% of word occurrences. [ 14 ] Word meaning is in principle infinitely variable and context-sensitive. It does not divide up easily into distinct or discrete sub-meanings. [ 15 ] Lexicographers frequently discover in corpora loose and overlapping word meanings, and standard or conventional meanings extended, modulated, and exploited in a bewildering variety of ways. The art of lexicography is to generalize from the corpus to definitions that evoke and explain the full range of meaning of a word, making it seem like words are well-behaved semantically. However, it is not at all clear if these same meaning distinctions are applicable in computational applications , as the decisions of lexicographers are usually driven by other considerations. In 2009, a task – named lexical substitution – was proposed as a possible solution to the sense discreteness problem. [ 16 ] The task consists of providing a substitute for a word in context that preserves the meaning of the original word (potentially, substitutes can be chosen from the full lexicon of the target language, thus overcoming discreteness). Approaches and methods [ edit ] There are two main approaches to WSD – deep approaches and shallow approaches. Deep approaches presume access to a comprehensive body of world knowledge . These approaches are generally not considered to be very successful in practice, mainly because such a body of knowledge does not exist in a computer-readable format, outside very limited domains. [ 17 ] Additionally due to the long tradition in computational linguistics , of trying such approaches in terms of coded knowledge and in some cases, it can be hard to distinguish between knowledge involved in linguistic or world knowledge. The first attempt was that by Margaret Masterman and her colleagues, at the Cambridge Language Research Unit in England, in the 1950s. This attempt used as data a punched-card version of Roget's Thesaurus and its numbered \"heads\", as an indicator of topics and looked for repetitions in text, using a set intersection algorithm. It was not very successful, [ 18 ] but had strong relationships to later work, especially Yarowsky's machine learning optimisation of a thesaurus method in the 1990s. Shallow approaches do not try to understand the text, but instead consider the surrounding words. These rules can be automatically derived by the computer, using a training corpus of words tagged with their word senses. This approach, while theoretically not as powerful as deep approaches, gives superior results in practice, due to the computer's limited world knowledge. There are four conventional approaches to WSD: Dictionary - and knowledge-based methods: These rely primarily on dictionaries, thesauri, and lexical knowledge bases , without using any corpus evidence. Semi-supervised or minimally supervised methods : These make use of a secondary source of knowledge such as a small annotated corpus as seed data in a bootstrapping process, or a word-aligned bilingual corpus. Supervised methods : These make use of sense-annotated corpora to train from. Unsupervised methods : These eschew (almost) completely external information and work directly from raw unannotated corpora. These methods are also known under the name of word sense discrimination . Almost all these approaches work by defining a window of n content words around each word to be disambiguated in the corpus, and statistically analyzing those n surrounding words. Two shallow approaches used to train and then disambiguate are Naïve Bayes classifiers and decision trees . In recent research, kernel-based methods such as support vector machines have shown superior performance in supervised learning . Graph-based approaches have also gained much attention from the research community, and currently achieve performance close to the state of the art. Dictionary- and knowledge-based methods [ edit ] The Lesk algorithm [ 19 ] is the seminal dictionary-based method. It is based on the hypothesis that words used together in text are related to each other and that the relation can be observed in the definitions of the words and their senses. Two (or more) words are disambiguated by finding the pair of dictionary senses with the greatest word overlap in their dictionary definitions. For example, when disambiguating the words in \"pine cone\", the definitions of the appropriate senses both include the words evergreen and tree (at least in one dictionary). A similar approach [ 20 ] searches for the shortest path between two words: the second word is iteratively searched among the definitions of every semantic variant of the first word, then among the definitions of every semantic variant of each word in the previous definitions and so on. Finally, the first word is disambiguated by selecting the semantic variant which minimizes the distance from the first to the second word. An alternative to the use of the definitions is to consider general word-sense relatedness and to compute the semantic similarity of each pair of word senses based on a given lexical knowledge base such as WordNet . Graph-based methods reminiscent of spreading activation research of the early days of AI research have been applied with some success. More complex graph-based approaches have been shown to perform almost as well as supervised methods [ 21 ] or even outperforming them on specific domains. [ 3 ] [ 22 ] Recently, it has been reported that simple graph connectivity measures , such as degree , perform state-of-the-art WSD in the presence of a sufficiently rich lexical knowledge base. [ 23 ] Also, automatically transferring knowledge in the form of semantic relations from Wikipedia to WordNet has been shown to boost simple knowledge-based methods, enabling them to rival the best supervised systems and even outperform them in a domain-specific setting. [ 24 ] The use of selectional preferences (or selectional restrictions) is also useful, for example, knowing that one typically cooks food, one can disambiguate the word bass in \"I am cooking basses\" (i.e., it's not a musical instrument). Supervised methods [ edit ] Supervised methods are based on the assumption that the context can provide enough evidence on its own to disambiguate words (hence, common sense and reasoning are deemed unnecessary). Probably every machine learning algorithm going has been applied to WSD, including associated techniques such as feature selection , parameter optimization, and ensemble learning . Support Vector Machines and memory-based learning have been shown to be the most successful approaches, to date, probably because they can cope with the high-dimensionality of the feature space. However, these supervised methods are subject to a new knowledge acquisition bottleneck since they rely on substantial amounts of manually sense-tagged corpora for training, which are laborious and expensive to create. Semi-supervised methods [ edit ] Because of the lack of training data, many word sense disambiguation algorithms use semi-supervised learning , which allows both labeled and unlabeled data. The Yarowsky algorithm was an early example of such an algorithm. [ 25 ] It uses the ‘One sense per collocation’ and the ‘One sense per discourse’ properties of human languages for word sense disambiguation. From observation, words tend to exhibit only one sense in most given discourse and in a given collocation. [ 26 ] The bootstrapping approach starts from a small amount of seed data for each word: either manually tagged training examples or a small number of surefire decision rules (e.g., 'play' in the context of 'bass' almost always indicates the musical instrument). The seeds are used to train an initial classifier , using any supervised method. This classifier is then used on the untagged portion of the corpus to extract a larger training set, in which only the most confident classifications are included. The process repeats, each new classifier being trained on a successively larger training corpus, until the whole corpus is consumed, or until a given maximum number of iterations is reached. Other semi-supervised techniques use large quantities of untagged corpora to provide co-occurrence information that supplements the tagged corpora. These techniques have the potential to help in the adaptation of supervised models to different domains. Also, an ambiguous word in one language is often translated into different words in a second language depending on the sense of the word. Word-aligned bilingual corpora have been used to infer cross-lingual sense distinctions, a kind of semi-supervised system. [ citation needed ] Unsupervised methods [ edit ] Main article: Word sense induction Unsupervised learning is the greatest challenge for WSD researchers. The underlying assumption is that similar senses occur in similar contexts, and thus senses can be induced from text by clustering word occurrences using some measure of similarity of context, [ 27 ] a task referred to as word sense induction or discrimination. Then, new occurrences of the word can be classified into the closest induced clusters/senses. Performance has been lower than for the other methods described above, but comparisons are difficult since senses induced must be mapped to a known dictionary of word senses. If a mapping to a set of dictionary senses is not desired, cluster-based evaluations (including measures of entropy and purity) can be performed. Alternatively, word sense induction methods can be tested and compared within an application. For instance, it has been shown that word sense induction improves Web search result clustering by increasing the quality of result clusters and the degree diversification of result lists. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] It is hoped that unsupervised learning will overcome the knowledge acquisition bottleneck because they are not dependent on manual effort. Representing words considering their context through fixed-size dense vectors ( word embeddings ) has become one of the most fundamental blocks in several NLP systems. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Even though most of traditional word-embedding techniques conflate words with multiple meanings into a single vector representation, they still can be used to improve WSD. [ 33 ] A simple approach to employ pre-computed word embeddings to represent word senses is to compute the centroids of sense clusters. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] In addition to word-embedding techniques, lexical databases (e.g., WordNet , ConceptNet , BabelNet ) can also assist unsupervised systems in mapping words and their senses as dictionaries. Some techniques that combine lexical databases and word embeddings are presented in AutoExtend [ 36 ] [ 37 ] and Most Suitable Sense Annotation (MSSA). [ 38 ] In AutoExtend, [ 37 ] they present a method that decouples an object input representation into its properties, such as words and their word senses. AutoExtend uses a graph structure to map words (e.g. text) and non-word (e.g. synsets in WordNet ) objects as nodes and the relationship between nodes as edges. The relations (edges) in AutoExtend can either express the addition or similarity between its nodes. The former captures the intuition behind the offset calculus, [ 30 ] while the latter defines the similarity between two nodes. In MSSA, [ 38 ] an unsupervised disambiguation system uses the similarity between word senses in a fixed context window to select the most suitable word sense using a pre-trained word-embedding model and WordNet . For each context window, MSSA calculates the centroid of each word sense definition by averaging the word vectors of its words in WordNet's glosses (i.e., short defining gloss and one or more usage example) using a pre-trained word-embedding model. These centroids are later used to select the word sense with the highest similarity of a target word to its immediately adjacent neighbors (i.e., predecessor and successor words). After all words are annotated and disambiguated, they can be used as a training corpus in any standard word-embedding technique. In its improved version, MSSA can make use of word sense embeddings to repeat its disambiguation process iteratively. Other approaches [ edit ] Other approaches may vary differently in their methods: Domain-driven disambiguation; [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Identification of dominant word senses; [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] WSD using Cross-Lingual Evidence. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] WSD solution in John Ball's language independent NLU combining Patom Theory and RRG (Role and Reference Grammar) Type inference in constraint-based grammars [ 46 ] Other languages [ edit ] Hindi : Lack of lexical resources in Hindi have hindered the performance of supervised models of WSD, while the unsupervised models suffer due to extensive morphology. A possible solution to this problem is the design of a WSD model by means of parallel corpora . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] The creation of the Hindi WordNet has paved way for several Supervised methods which have been proven to produce a higher accuracy in disambiguating nouns. [ 49 ] Local impediments and summary [ edit ] The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is perhaps the major impediment to solving the WSD problem. Unsupervised methods rely on knowledge about word senses, which is only sparsely formulated in dictionaries and lexical databases. Supervised methods depend crucially on the existence of manually annotated examples for every word sense, a requisite that can so far [ when? ] be met only for a handful of words for testing purposes, as it is done in the Senseval exercises. One of the most promising trends in WSD research is using the largest corpus ever accessible, the World Wide Web , to acquire lexical information automatically. [ 50 ] WSD has been traditionally understood as an intermediate language engineering technology which could improve applications such as information retrieval (IR). In this case, however, the reverse is also true: web search engines implement simple and robust IR techniques that can successfully mine the Web for information to use in WSD. The historic lack of training data has provoked the appearance of some new algorithms and techniques, as described in Automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora . External knowledge sources [ edit ] Knowledge is a fundamental component of WSD. Knowledge sources provide data which are essential to associate senses with words. They can vary from corpora of texts, either unlabeled or annotated with word senses, to machine-readable dictionaries, thesauri, glossaries, ontologies, etc. They can be [ 51 ] [ 52 ] classified as follows: Structured: Machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) Ontologies Thesauri Unstructured: Collocation resources Other resources (such as word frequency lists , stoplists , domain labels, [ 53 ] etc.) Corpora : raw corpora and sense-annotated corpora Evaluation [ edit ] Comparing and evaluating different WSD systems is extremely difficult, because of the different test sets, sense inventories, and knowledge resources adopted. Before the organization of specific evaluation campaigns most systems were assessed on in-house, often small-scale, data sets . In order to test one's algorithm, developers should spend their time to annotate all word occurrences. And comparing methods even on the same corpus is not eligible if there is different sense inventories. In order to define common evaluation datasets and procedures, public evaluation campaigns have been organized. Senseval (now renamed SemEval ) is an international word sense disambiguation competition, held every three years since 1998: Senseval-1 (1998), Senseval-2 (2001), Senseval-3 [ usurped ] (2004), and its successor, SemEval (2007). The objective of the competition is to organize different lectures, preparing and hand-annotating corpus for testing systems, perform a comparative evaluation of WSD systems in several kinds of tasks, including all-words and lexical sample WSD for different languages, and, more recently, new tasks such as semantic role labeling , gloss WSD, lexical substitution , etc. The systems submitted for evaluation to these competitions usually integrate different techniques and often combine supervised and knowledge-based methods (especially for avoiding bad performance in lack of training examples). In recent years 2007-2012 , the WSD evaluation task choices had grown and the criterion for evaluating WSD has changed drastically depending on the variant of the WSD evaluation task. Below enumerates the variety of WSD tasks: Task design choices [ edit ] As technology evolves, the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks grows in different flavors towards various research directions and for more languages: Classic monolingual WSD evaluation tasks use WordNet as the sense inventory and are largely based on supervised / semi-supervised classification with the manually sense annotated corpora: [ 54 ] Classic English WSD uses the Princeton WordNet as it sense inventory and the primary classification input is normally based on the SemCor corpus. Classical WSD for other languages uses their respective WordNet as sense inventories and sense annotated corpora tagged in their respective languages. Often researchers will also tapped on the SemCor corpus and aligned bitexts with English as its source language Cross-lingual WSD evaluation task is also focused on WSD across 2 or more languages simultaneously. Unlike the Multilingual WSD tasks, instead of providing manually sense-annotated examples for each sense of a polysemous noun, the sense inventory is built up on the basis of parallel corpora, e.g. Europarl corpus. [ 55 ] Multilingual WSD evaluation tasks focused on WSD across 2 or more languages simultaneously, using their respective WordNets as its sense inventories or BabelNet as multilingual sense inventory. [ 56 ] It evolved from the Translation WSD evaluation tasks that took place in Senseval-2. A popular approach is to carry out monolingual WSD and then map the source language senses into the corresponding target word translations. [ 57 ] Word Sense Induction and Disambiguation task is a combined task evaluation where the sense inventory is first induced from a fixed training set data, consisting of polysemous words and the sentence that they occurred in, then WSD is performed on a different testing data set .

Adoption [ edit ] The Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA Astrophysics Data System , which coined and prefers the term \"bibcode\". [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Format [ edit ] The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA where YYYY is the four-digit year of the reference and JJJJJ is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, VVVV is the volume number, M indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., L for a letters section), PPPP gives the starting page number, and A is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods ( . ) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the M column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column M . The remaining four digits are used in the page field. [ 2 ] Examples [ edit ] Some examples of bibcodes are: Bibcode Reference 1974AJ.....79..819H Heintz, W. D.

It should not be confused with profit shares, in which scheme only the profit is shared, i.e., the revenue left over after costs have been removed, nor with stock shares , which may be bought and sold and whose value may fluctuate. Revenue shares are often used in industries such as game development, wherein a studio lacks sufficient capital or investment to pay upfront, or in instances when a studio or company wishes to share the risks and rewards with its team members. Revenue shares allow the stakeholders to realize returns as soon as revenue is earned before any costs are deducted. Revenue sharing in Internet marketing is also known as cost per sale , in which the cost of advertising is determined by the revenue generated as a result of the advertisement itself. This method accounts for about 80% of affiliate marketing programs, [ 1 ] primarily dominated by online retailers such as Amazon and eBay. Web-based companies such as Helium, HubPages , Infobarrel, and Squidoo also practice a form of revenue sharing, in which a company invites writers to create content for a website in exchange for a share of its advertising revenue, giving the authors the possibility of ongoing income from a single piece of work, and guaranteeing to the commissioning company that it will never pay more for content than it generates in advertising revenue. Pay rates vary dramatically from site to site, depending on the success of the site and the popularity of individual articles. In professional sports leagues, \"revenue sharing\" commonly refers to the distribution of proceeds generated by ticket sales to a given event; [ 2 ] the amount of money distributed to a visiting team can significantly impact a team's total revenue, which in turn affects the team's ability to attract (and pay for) talent and resources. In 1981, for example, the Scottish Premier League changed its policy from splitting a match's receipts evenly between its two competing football teams over to a system in which the hosting team could keep all the proceeds from matches hosted at its facilities. This move is generally believed to have negatively affected the league's parity and enhanced the dominance of Celtic F.C. and Rangers F.C. [ 3 ] In contrast, the National Football League distributes television revenue to all teams equally, regardless of team performance or number of viewers. In July 2023, Twitter distributed the first ad-sharing payments to Twitter creators. [ 4 ] References [ edit ] ^ AffStat Report . 2007.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] SEO targets unpaid search traffic (usually referred to as \" organic \" results) rather than direct traffic, referral traffic, social media traffic, or paid traffic . Organic search engine traffic originates from a variety of kinds of searches, including image search , video search , academic search , [ 3 ] news search, industry-specific vertical search engines, and large language models. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, the algorithms that dictate search engine results, what people search for, the actual search queries or keywords typed into search engines, and which search engines are preferred by a target audience. SEO helps websites attract more visitors from a search engine and rank higher within a search engine results page (SERP), aiming to either convert the visitors or build brand awareness. [ 4 ] History Webmasters and content providers began optimizing websites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web . Initially, webmasters submitted the address of a page, or URL to the various search engines, which would send a web crawler to crawl that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed . [ 5 ] According to a 2004 article by former industry analyst and current Google employee Danny Sullivan , the phrase \"search engine optimization\" came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits SEO practitioner Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term. [ 6 ] Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB . Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Flawed data in meta tags, such as those that were inaccurate or incomplete, created the potential for pages to be mischaracterized in irrelevant searches. [ 7 ] [ dubious – discuss ] Web content providers also manipulated attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines. [ 8 ] By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank in search engines and that some webmasters were manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek , adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings. [ 9 ] By relying on factors such as keyword density , which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals. [ 10 ] Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms , taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate. [ citation needed ] Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website. [ 13 ] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the \"crawl rate\", and track the web pages index status. In 2015, it was reported that Google was developing and promoting mobile search as a key feature within future products. In response, many brands began to take a different approach to their Internet marketing strategies. [ 14 ] In the 2020s, the rise of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT , Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini gave rise to discussion around a concept variously referred to as generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization or artificial intelligence optimization . This approach focuses on optimizing content for inclusion in AI-generated answers provided by large language models (LLMs). This shift has led digital marketers to discuss content formats, authority signals, and how structured data is presented to make content more \"promptable\". [ 15 ] It has also been argued that each of these tactics should be considered as subsets of \"search experience optimization,\" described by Ahrefs as \"optimizing a brand’s presence for non-linear search journeys over multiple platforms, not just Google.\" [ 16 ] Relationship between Google and SEO industry In 1998, two graduate students at Stanford University , Larry Page and Sergey Brin , developed \"Backrub\", a search engine that relied on a mathematical algorithm to rate the prominence of web pages. The number calculated by the algorithm, PageRank , is a function of the quantity and strength of inbound links . [ 17 ] PageRank estimates the likelihood that a given page will be reached by a web user who randomly surfs the web and follows links from one page to another. In effect, this means that some links are stronger than others, as a higher PageRank page is more likely to be reached by the random web surfer. Page and Brin founded Google in 1998. [ 18 ] Google attracted a loyal following among the growing number of Internet users, who liked its simple design. [ 19 ] Off-page factors (such as PageRank and hyperlink analysis) were considered as well as on-page factors (such as keyword frequency, meta tags , headings, links and site structure) to enable Google to avoid the kind of manipulation seen in search engines that only considered on-page factors for their rankings. Although PageRank was more difficult to game , webmasters had already developed link-building tools and schemes to influence the Inktomi search engine, and these methods proved similarly applicable to gaming PageRank. Many sites focus on exchanging, buying, and selling links, often on a massive scale. Some of these schemes involved the creation of thousands of sites for the sole purpose of link spamming . [ 20 ] By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. [ 21 ] The leading search engines, Google, Bing , and Yahoo , do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization and have shared their personal opinions. [ 22 ] Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. [ 23 ] In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. [ 24 ] In 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank. [ 25 ] On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. Matt Cutts , a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that Google Bot would no longer treat any no follow links, in the same way, to prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting. [ 26 ] As a result of this change, the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of PageRank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated JavaScript and thus permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally, several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes , Flash , and JavaScript. [ 27 ] In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. [ 28 ] On June 8, 2010 a new web indexing system called Google Caffeine was announced. Designed to allow users to find news results, forum posts, and other content much sooner after publishing than before, Google Caffeine was a change to the way Google updated its index in order to make things show up quicker on Google than before. According to Carrie Grimes, the software engineer who announced Caffeine for Google, \"Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for web searches than our last index...\" [ 29 ] Google Instant , real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs, the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. [ 30 ] Google has implemented numerous algorithm updates to improve search quality, including Panda (2011) for content quality, Penguin (2012) for link spam, Hummingbird (2013) for natural language processing, and BERT (2019) for query understanding. These updates reflect the ongoing evolution of search technology and Google's efforts to combat spam while improving user experience. On May 20, 2025, Google announced that AI Mode would be released to all US users. AI Mode uses what Google calls a \"query fan-out technique\" which breaks down the search query into multiple sub-topics which generates additional search queries for the user. [ 31 ] Methods Getting indexed A simple illustration of the Pagerank algorithm. Percentage shows the perceived importance. The leading search engines, such as Google, Bing, Brave Search and Yahoo!, use crawlers to find pages for their algorithmic search results. Pages that are linked from other search engine-indexed pages do not need to be submitted because they are found automatically. The Yahoo! Directory and DMOZ , two major directories which closed in 2014 and 2017 respectively, both required manual submission and human editorial review. [ 32 ] Google offers Google Search Console , for which an XML Sitemap feed can be created and submitted for free to ensure that all pages are found, especially pages that are not discoverable by automatically following links [ 33 ] in addition to their URL submission console. [ 34 ] Yahoo! formerly operated a paid submission service that guaranteed to crawl for a cost per click ; [ 35 ] however, this practice was discontinued in 2009. Search engine crawlers may look at a number of different factors when crawling a site. Not every page is indexed by search engines. The distance of pages from the root directory of a site may also be a factor in whether or not pages get crawled. [ 36 ] Mobile devices are used for the majority of Google searches. [ 37 ] In November 2016, Google announced a major change to the way they are crawling websites and started to make their index mobile-first, which means the mobile version of a given website becomes the starting point for what Google includes in their index. [ 38 ] In May 2019, Google updated the rendering engine of their crawler to be the latest version of Chromium (74 at the time of the announcement). Google indicated that they would regularly update the Chromium rendering engine to the latest version. [ 39 ] In December 2019, Google began updating the User-Agent string of their crawler to reflect the latest Chrome version used by their rendering service. The delay was to allow webmasters time to update their code that responded to particular bot User-Agent strings. Google ran evaluations and felt confident the impact would be minor. [ 40 ] Preventing crawling Main article: Robots exclusion standard To avoid undesirable content in the search indexes, webmasters can instruct spiders not to crawl certain files or directories through the standard robots.txt file in the root directory of the domain. Additionally, a page can be explicitly excluded from a search engine's database by using a meta tag specific to robots (usually <meta name=\"robots\" content=\"noindex\"> ). When a search engine visits a site, the robots.txt located in the root directory is the first file crawled. The robots.txt file is then parsed and will instruct the robot as to which pages are not to be crawled. As a search engine crawler may keep a cached copy of this file, it may on occasion crawl pages a webmaster does not wish to crawl. Pages typically prevented from being crawled include login-specific pages such as shopping carts and user-specific content such as search results from internal searches. In March 2007, Google warned webmasters that they should prevent indexing of internal search results because those pages are considered search spam. [ 41 ] In 2020, Google sunsetted the standard (and open-sourced their code) and now treats it as a hint rather than a directive. To adequately ensure that pages are not indexed, a page-level robot's meta tag should be included. [ 42 ] Increasing prominence A variety of methods can increase the prominence of a webpage within the search results. Cross linking between pages of the same website to provide more links to important pages may improve its visibility. Page design makes users trust a site and want to stay once they find it. When people bounce off a site, it counts against the site and affects its credibility. [ 43 ] Writing content that includes frequently searched keyword phrases so as to be relevant to a wide variety of search queries will tend to increase traffic. Updating content so as to keep search engines crawling back frequently can give additional weight to a site. Adding relevant keywords to a web page's metadata, including the title tag and meta description , will tend to improve the relevancy of a site's search listings, thus increasing traffic. URL canonicalization of web pages accessible via multiple URLs, using the canonical link element [ 44 ] or via 301 redirects can help make sure links to different versions of the URL all count towards the page's link popularity score. These are known as incoming links, which point to the URL and can count towards the page link's popularity score, impacting the credibility of a website. [ 43 ] White hat versus black hat techniques Common white-hat methods of search engine optimization SEO techniques can be classified into two broad categories: techniques that search engine companies recommend as part of good design (\"white hat\"), and those techniques of which search engines do not approve (\"black hat\"). Search engines attempt to minimize the effect of the latter, among them spamdexing . Industry commentators have classified these methods and the practitioners who employ them as either white hat SEO or black hat SEO. [ 45 ] White hats tend to produce results that last a long time, whereas black hats anticipate that their sites may eventually be banned either temporarily or permanently once the search engines discover what they are doing. [ 46 ] An SEO technique is considered a white hat if it conforms to the search engines' guidelines and involves no deception. As the search engine guidelines [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 47 ] are not written as a series of rules or commandments, this is an important distinction to note. White hat SEO is not just about following guidelines but is about ensuring that the content a search engine indexes and subsequently ranks is the same content a user will see. White hat advice is generally summed up as creating content for users, not for search engines, and then making that content easily accessible to the online \"spider\" algorithms, rather than attempting to trick the algorithm from its intended purpose. White hat SEO is in many ways similar to web development that promotes accessibility, [ 48 ] although the two are not identical. Black hat SEO attempts to improve rankings in ways that are disapproved of by the search engines or involve deception. One black hat technique uses hidden text, either as text colored similar to the background, in an invisible div , or positioned off-screen. Another method gives a different page depending on whether the page is being requested by a human visitor or a search engine, a technique known as cloaking . Another category sometimes used is grey hat SEO . This is in between the black hat and white hat approaches, where the methods employed avoid the site being penalized but do not act in producing the best content for users. Grey hat SEO is entirely focused on improving search engine rankings. Search engines may penalize sites they discover using black or grey hat methods, either by reducing their rankings or eliminating their listings from their databases altogether. Such penalties can be applied either automatically by the search engines' algorithms or by a manual site review. One example was the February 2006 Google removal of both BMW Germany and Ricoh Germany for the use of deceptive practices. [ 49 ] Both companies subsequently apologized, fixed the offending pages, and were restored to Google's search engine results page. [ 50 ] Companies that employ black hat techniques or other spammy tactics can get their client websites banned from the search results. In 2005, the Wall Street Journal reported on a company, Traffic Power , which allegedly used high-risk techniques and failed to disclose those risks to its clients. [ 51 ] Wired magazine reported that the same company sued blogger and SEO Aaron Wall for writing about the ban. [ 52 ] Google's Matt Cutts later confirmed that Google had banned Traffic Power and some of its clients. [ 53 ] As marketing strategy SEO represents one approach within digital marketing, alongside other strategies such as pay-per-click advertising and social media marketing. Search engine marketing (SEM) is the practice of designing, running, and optimizing search engine ad campaigns. Its difference from SEO is most simply depicted as the difference between paid and unpaid priority ranking in search results. SEM focuses on prominence more so than relevance; website developers should regard SEM with the utmost importance with consideration to visibility as most navigate to the primary listings of their search. [ 54 ] A successful Internet marketing campaign may also depend upon building high-quality web pages to engage and persuade internet users, setting up analytics programs to enable site owners to measure results, and improving a site's conversion rate . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] In November 2015, Google released a full 160-page version of its Search Quality Rating Guidelines to the public, [ 57 ] which revealed a shift in their focus towards \"usefulness\" and mobile local search . In recent years the mobile market has exploded, overtaking the use of desktops, as shown in by StatCounter in October 2016, where they analyzed 2.5 million websites and found that 51.3% of the pages were loaded by a mobile device. [ 58 ] Google has been one of the companies that are utilizing the popularity of mobile usage by encouraging websites to use their Google Search Console , the Mobile-Friendly Test, which allows companies to measure up their website to the search engine results and determine how user-friendly their websites are. The closer the keywords are together their ranking will improve based on key terms. [ 43 ] SEO may generate an adequate return on investment . However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantee and uncertainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors. [ 59 ] Search engines can change their algorithms, impacting a website's search engine ranking, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt , in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes – almost 1.5 per day. [ 60 ] Industry analysts note that websites may face risks from algorithm changes that can significantly impact organic traffic. In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO. International markets and SEO Optimization techniques are highly tuned to the dominant search engines in the target market. The search engines' market shares vary from market to market, as does competition. Google has maintained dominant market share in most regions, with varying percentages by market. [ 61 ] In markets outside the United States, Google's share is often larger, and data showed Google was the dominant search engine worldwide as of 2007. [ 62 ] As of 2006, Google had an 85–90% market share in Germany. [ 63 ] As of March 2024, Google still had a significant market share of 89.85% in Germany. [ 64 ] As of March 2024, Google's market share in the UK was 93.61%. [ 65 ] Successful search engine optimization (SEO) for international markets requires more than just translating web pages. It may also involve registering a domain name with a country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) or a relevant top-level domain (TLD) for the target market, choosing web hosting with a local IP address or server, and using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve website speed and performance globally. It is also important to understand the local culture so that the content feels relevant to the audience. This includes conducting keyword research for each market, using hreflang tags to target the right languages, and building local backlinks. However, the core SEO principles—such as creating high-quality content, improving user experience, and building links—remain the same, regardless of language or region. [ 63 ] Regional search engines have a strong presence in specific markets: China: Baidu leads the market, controlling about 70 to 80% market share. [ 66 ] South Korea: Since the end of 2021, Naver , a domestic web portal, has gained prominence in the country. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] Russia: Yandex is the leading search engine in Russia. As of December 2023, it accounted for at least 63.8% of the market share. [ 69 ] Multilingual SEO By the early 2000s, businesses recognized that the web and search engines could help them reach global audiences. As a result, the need for multilingual SEO emerged. [ 70 ] In the early years of international SEO development, simple translation was seen as sufficient. However, over time, it became clear that localization and transcreation—adapting content to local language, culture, and emotional resonance—were more effective than basic translation. [ 71 ] Legal precedents On October 17, 2002, SearchKing filed suit in the United States District Court , Western District of Oklahoma, against the search engine Google. SearchKing's claim was that Google's tactics to prevent spamdexing constituted a tortious interference with contractual relations. On May 27, 2003, the court granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint because SearchKing \"failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\" [ 72 ] [ 73 ] In March 2006, KinderStart filed a lawsuit against Google over search engine rankings. KinderStart's website was removed from Google's index prior to the lawsuit, and the amount of traffic to the site dropped by 70%. On March 16, 2007, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ( San Jose Division) dismissed KinderStart's complaint without leave to amend and partially granted Google's motion for Rule 11 sanctions against KinderStart's attorney, requiring him to pay part of Google's legal expenses.

Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources: \"VisualRank\" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( June 2021 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) VisualRank is a system for finding and ranking images by analysing and comparing their content , rather than searching image names, Web links or other text. Google scientists made their VisualRank work public in a paper describing applying PageRank to Google image search at the International World Wide Web Conference in Beijing in 2008. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Methods [ edit ] Both computer vision techniques and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) are used in the VisualRank algorithm . Consider an image search initiated by a text query. An existing search technique based on image metadata and surrounding text is used to retrieve the initial result candidates ( PageRank ), which along with other images in the index are clustered in a graph according to their similarity (which is precomputed). Centrality is then measured on the clustering, which will return the most canonical image(s) with respect to the query. The idea here is that agreement between users of the web about the image and its related concepts will result in those images being deemed more similar. VisualRank is defined iteratively by V R = S ∗ × V R {\\displaystyle VR=S^{*}\\times VR} , where S ∗ {\\displaystyle S^{*}} is the image similarity matrix. As matrices are used, eigenvector centrality will be the measure applied, with repeated multiplication of V R {\\displaystyle VR} and S ∗ {\\displaystyle S^{*}} producing the eigenvector we're looking for. Clearly, the image similarity measure is crucial to the performance of VisualRank since it determines the underlying graph structure. The main VisualRank system begins with local feature vectors being extracted from images using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). Local feature descriptors are used instead of color histograms as they allow similarity to be considered between images with potential rotation, scale, and perspective transformations. Locality-sensitive hashing is then applied to these feature vectors using the p-stable distribution scheme . In addition to this, LSH amplification using AND/OR constructions are applied. As part of the applied scheme, a Gaussian distribution is used under the ℓ 2 {\\displaystyle \\ell _{2}} norm . References [ edit ] ^ Yushi Jing and Baluja, S.

It is used to build and maintain a list or lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . More information: This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing \"attention en masse \" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Typically, tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software (see Special:TrackingCategories for an overview of the latter). Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This is a tracking category for {{ cite journal }} templates and for {{ citation }} templates that use the |journal= , |doi= , and |page(s)= parameters. Module:Citation/CS1 emits this category when the value assigned to |page= or |pages= appears to be an article number and not a page number. Module:Citation/CS1 skips |page(s)= values that: are ranges separated by underscore, hyphen, emdash, endash, figure dash, or minus character are comma- or semicolon-separated lists of pages have external urls are digit-only values less than 10000 For those templates that are not skipped, the module compares the trailing (rightmost) characters of the |doi= value against the whole value of the |page(s)= value. There are a variety of tests: five or more digits – |page=100393 matches |doi=10.1016/j.gfs.2020.100393 five or more characters – |page=CD004052 matches |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004052 five or more characters with e prefix (case insensitive) – |page=eadl0822 matches |doi=10.1126/sciadv.adl0822 exactly eight digits; modified by the test to insert a dot between the 4th and 5th digits – |page=20170301 modified to 2017.0301 matches |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2017.0301 CD prefix (case insensitive) followed by (typically) six digits; modified by the test to append .pub n suffix where n is a single digit – |page=CD005216 matches |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005216.pub2 To fix cs1|2 templates that emit this maintenance message/category, ensure that the value assigned to |page= is an insource location page number. When the page number is not a page number, change |page= to |article-number= . Pages with this condition are automatically placed in Category:CS1 maint: article number as page number. [ a ] By default, Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 error messages are visible to all readers and maintenance messages are hidden from all readers. To display maintenance messages in the rendered article, include the following text in your common CSS page ( common.css ) or your specific skin's CSS page and ( skin.css ). (Note to new editors: those CSS pages are specific to you, and control your view of pages, by adding to your user account's CSS code. If you have not yet created such a page, then clicking one of the .css links above will yield a page that starts \"Wikipedia does not have a user page with this exact name.\" Click the \"Start the User: username / filename page\" link, paste the text below, save the page, follow the instructions at the bottom of the new page on bypassing your browser's cache, and finally, in order to see the previously hidden maintenance messages, refresh the page you were editing earlier.) : root . mw-parser-output . cs1-maint { display : inline ;} /* display Citation Style 1 maintenance messages */ To display hidden-by-default error messages : : root . mw-parser-output . cs1-hidden-error { display : inline ;} /* display hidden Citation Style 1 error messages */ Even with this CSS installed, older pages in Wikipedia's cache may not have been updated to show these error messages even though the page is listed in one of the tracking categories. A null edit will resolve that issue. After (error and/maintenance) messages are displayed, it might still not be easy to find them in a large article with a lot of citations. Messages can then be found by searching (with Ctrl-F) for \"(help)\" or \"cs1\". To hide normally-displayed error messages : : root . mw-parser-output . cs1-visible-error { display : none ;} /* hide Citation Style 1 error messages */ You can personalize the display of these messages (such as changing the color), but you will need to ask someone who knows CSS or at the technical village pump if you do not understand how.

( / ˈ b aɪ d uː / BY -doo ; Chinese : 百度 ; pinyin : Bǎidù ; lit. 'hundred times') is a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet services and artificial intelligence . It holds a dominant position in China's search engine market (via Baidu Search), and provides a wide variety of other internet services such as Baidu App (Baidu's flagship app for search and newsfeed), Baidu Baike (an online user created Wikipedia -like encyclopedia ), iQIYI (a video streaming service), and Baidu Tieba (a keyword-based discussion forum similar to Reddit ). Besides its core internet search business, Baidu has diversified into several high-growth areas. The company is a leading player in autonomous driving (Baidu Apollo), [ 3 ] and smart consumer electronics (Xiaodu). [ 4 ] With over a decade of investment in artificial intelligence , Baidu is one of the few tech companies globally to offer a full-service AI stack, including software, chips , cloud infrastructure , foundation models , and applications . [ 5 ] A variable interest entity for Baidu to enable investment of foreign capital is incorporated in the Cayman Islands . [ 2 ] Baidu was incorporated in January 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu . Baidu has origins in RankDex, an earlier search engine developed by Robin Li in 1996, before he founded Baidu in 2000. [ 6 ] The company is headquartered in Beijing 's Haidian District . [ 7 ] In December 2007, Baidu became the first Chinese company to be included in the NASDAQ-100 index. [ 8 ] As of May 2018, Baidu's market cap rose to US$99 billion. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In October 2018, Baidu became the first Chinese firm to join the United States–based computer ethics consortium Partnership on AI . [ 12 ] The Chinese government views Baidu as one of its national champion corporations. [ 13 ] : 156–157 History [ edit ] Early development [ edit ] Baidu headquarters building completed in 2009 In 1994, Robin Li ( Pinyin : Li Yanhong, Chinese : 李彦宏 ) joined IDD Information Services, a New Jersey division of Dow Jones and Company , where he helped develop software for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal . [ 14 ] He also worked on developing better algorithms for search engines and remained at IDD Information Services from May 1994 to June 1997. In 1996, while at IDD, Li developed the RankDex site-scoring algorithm for search engines results page ranking [ 6 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and received a US patent for the technology. [ 17 ] Launched in 1996, [ 6 ] RankDex was the first search engine that used hyperlinks to measure the quality of websites it was indexing. [ 18 ] Li referred to his search mechanism as \"link analysis,\" which involved ranking the popularity of a web site based on how many other sites had linked to it. [ 19 ] It predated the similar PageRank algorithm used by Google two years later in 1998; [ 20 ] Google founder Larry Page referenced Li's work as a citation in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank. [ 6 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Li later used his RankDex technology for the Baidu search engine. Baidu was incorporated on 18 January 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu . [ 7 ] In 2001, Baidu allowed advertisers to bid for ad space then pay Baidu every time a customer clicked on an ad, predating Google's approach to advertising. [ 19 ] In 2003, Baidu launched a news search engine and picture search engine, adopting a special identification technology capable of identifying and grouping the articles. [ 22 ] 2005: Public Listing on NASDAQ [ edit ] Baidu went public on Wall Street through a variable interest entity (VIE) based in the Cayman Islands on 5 August 2005. [ 23 ] In 2007, Chinese government and Chinese industry sources stated that Baidu received a license from Beijing, which allows the search engine to become a full-fledged news website. Thus Baidu is able to provide its own reports, besides showing certain results as a search engine. Baidu was the first Chinese search engine to receive such a license. [ 24 ] Baidu started its Japanese language search service, run by Baidu Japan, the company's first regular service outside of China in 2008. [ 25 ] The Japanese search engine closed on 16 March 2015. [ 26 ] On 31 July 2012, Baidu announced that it would team up with Sina to provide mobile search results. [ 27 ] On 18 November 2012, Baidu announced that it would be partnering with Qualcomm to offer free cloud storage to Android users with Snapdragon processors. [ 28 ] On 2 August 2013, Baidu launched its Personal Assistant app, designed to help CEOs, managers and the white-collar workers manage their business relationships. [ 29 ] On 16 May 2014, Baidu appointed Dr. Andrew Ng as chief scientist. Dr. Ng will lead Baidu Research in Silicon Valley and Beijing. [ 30 ] On 18 July 2014, the company launched a Brazilian version of the search engine, Baidu Busca . [ 31 ] On 9 October 2014, Baidu announced acquisition of Brazilian local e-commerce site Peixe Urbano. [ 32 ] 2017: Launch of Autonomous Driving Business [ edit ] In April 2017, Baidu announced the launch of its Apollo project (Apolong) , a self-driving vehicle platform, in a bid to help drive the development of autonomous cars including vehicle platform, hardware platform, open-source software platform and cloud data services. [ 33 ] Baidu plans to launch this project in July 2017, before gradually introducing fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. [ 34 ] In September 2017, Baidu launched a $1.5billion autonomous driving fund to invest in as many as 100 autonomous driving projects over the ensuing three years. [ 35 ] At the same time, Apollo open-source software version 1.5 was also launched. [ 36 ] In June 2017, Baidu partnered with Continental and Bosch , auto industry suppliers, on automated driving and connected cars. [ 37 ] In July 2017, Baidu GBU entered into a partnership with Snap Inc. to act as the company's official ad reseller for Snapchat in Greater China , South Korea , Japan and Singapore . [ 38 ] The partnership was extended in 2019. [ 39 ] In September 2017, Baidu rolled out a new portable talking translator that can listen and speak in several different languages. Smaller than a typical smartphone, the 140-gram translation device can also be used as a portable Wi-Fi router and is able to operate on networks in 80 countries. It is still under development. Baidu will also be inserting artificial intelligence (AI) technology into smartphones, through its deep learning platform. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] At the same period, it has also led a joint investment of US$12billion with Alibaba Group , Tencent , JD.com and Didi Chuxing , acquiring 35% of China Unicom 's stakes. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] In October 2017, according to The Wall Street Journal , Baidu would launch self-driving buses in China in 2018. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] In the same month, Baidu announced that its first annual Baidu World technology conference ( Bring AI to Life ) would be held and live-streamed on 16 November 2017, at China World Summit Wing and Kerry Hotel, bringing together Baidu executives, employees, partners, developers, and media to discuss the company's mission and strategy, technology breakthroughs, new product developments, and its open artificial-intelligence (AI) ecosystem. [ 47 ] China's government designated Baidu as one of its \"AI champions \" in 2018. [ 48 ] : 281 In 2018, Baidu divested the \"Global DU business\" portion of its overseas business, which developed a series of utility apps including ES File Explorer, DU Caller, Mobojoy, Photo Wonder and DU Recorder, etc. [ 49 ] This business now operates independently of Baidu under the name DO Global. [ 50 ] 2021: Hong Kong Secondary Listing [ edit ] In March 2021, Baidu secured a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising $3.1 billion. This marked the largest homecoming for a U.S.-traded Chinese company in Hong Kong since JD.com's listing the previous June. In August 2021 Baidu revealed a new Robocar concept said to be capable of Level 5 autonomous driving. [ 51 ] It also comes with the latest second-generation AI chip that can analyse the internal and external surroundings to provide predictive suggestions to proactively serve the needs of passengers. In June 2022, Jidu Auto , an intelligent electric vehicle company originally backed by Baidu and Geely unveiled its first concept ROBO-01 in the form of a pre-production vehicle. The ROBO-01 rides on the Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA) platform, a modular electric vehicle platform developed by Geely Holding . [ 52 ] In August 2023, Baidu publicly unveiled Ernie Bot , its large language model chatbot . [ 53 ] In October 2023, Baidu released a newer version Ernie 4.0 chatbot. [ 54 ] In September 2023, the search engine launched a chatbot based on its generative AI model, GenAI Ernie. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Robotaxi [ edit ] Main article: Baidu robotaxi As of April 2024, Apollo Go, Baidu's autonomous ride-hailing service, had completed six million rides using driverless robotaxis across 11 cities. The service operates a fleet of over 400 driverless vehicles in Wuhan. [ 57 ] Domain name redirection attack [ edit ] On 12 January 2010, Baidu.com's DNS records in the United States were altered such that browsers to baidu.com were redirected to a website purporting to be the Iranian Cyber Army , thought to be behind the attack on Twitter during the 2009 Iranian election protests , making the proper site unusable for four hours. [ 58 ] Internet users were met with a page saying \"This site has been attacked by Iranian Cyber Army \". [ 59 ] Chinese hackers later responded by attacking Iranian websites and leaving messages. [ 60 ] Baidu later launched legal action against Register.com for gross negligence after it was revealed that Register.com's technical support staff changed the email address for Baidu.com on the request of an unnamed individual, despite failing security verification procedures. Once the address had been changed, the individual was able to use the forgotten password feature to have Baidu's domain passwords sent directly to them, allowing them to accomplish the domain hijacking . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The lawsuit was settled out of court under undisclosed terms after Register.com issued an apology. [ 63 ] Baidu workers arrested [ edit ] On 6 August 2012, the BBC reported that three employees of Baidu were arrested on suspicion that they accepted bribes. The bribes were allegedly paid for deleting posts from the forum service. Four people were fired in connection with these arrests. [ 64 ] 91 Wireless acquisition [ edit ] On 16 July 2013, Baidu announced its intention to purchase 91 Wireless from NetDragon . 91 Wireless is best known for its app store, but it has been reported that the app store faces privacy and other legal issues. [ 65 ] On 14 August 2013, Baidu announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Baidu (Hong Kong) Limited has signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire 91 Wireless Web-soft Limited from NetDragon Web-soft Inc. [ 66 ] for $1.85 billion in what was reported to be the biggest deal ever in China's IT sector. [ 67 ] 2024: Artificial Intelligence Launch [ edit ] On 16 March 2025, Baidu released two new artificial intelligence models: ERNIE 4.5, a foundation model, and ERNIE X1, a reasoning model. Baidu claimed that ERNIE X1 performs comparably to DeepSeek 's R1 model at half the price. [ 68 ] Name [ edit ] The name Baidu ( 百度 ) literally means \"a hundred times\", or alternatively, \"countless times\". It is a quote from the last line of Xin Qiji 's ( 辛弃疾 ) classical poem \"Green Jade Table in The Lantern Festival\" ( 青玉案·元夕 ) saying: \"Having searched hundreds of times in the crowd, suddenly turning back, she is there in the dimmest candlelight.\" ( 众里寻他千 百度 , 蓦然回首, 那人却在灯火阑珊处。 ) [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Travel [ edit ] Qunar (Qunar Cayman Islands Limited), is a travel-booking service controlled by Baidu. As of 2013, Qunar had 31.4 million active users and raised $167 Million at its initial public offering that year. [ 71 ] It is listed at NASDAQ. [ 72 ] Advertisements [ edit ] Baidu's primary advertising product is called Baidu Tuiguang and is similar to Google Ads and AdSense . It is a pay per click advertising platform that allows advertisers to have their ads shown in Baidu search results pages and on other websites that are part of Baidu Union. However, Baidu's search results are also based on payments by advertisers. This has prompted criticism and skepticism among Chinese users, with People's Daily commenting in 2018 on issues regarding reliability of Baidu results. Often as many as the first two pages of search results tend to be paid advertisers. [ 73 ] Baidu sells its advertising products via a network of resellers. [ 74 ] Baidu's web administrative tools are all in Chinese, making it difficult for non-Chinese speakers to use. In 2012, a third-party company developed a tool with an interface in English for advertising on Baidu. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] Advertisers on Baidu must have a registered business address either in China or in specified East Asian countries. [ 77 ] Competition [ edit ] Baidu [ 78 ] competes with Sogou , Google Search , 360 Search (www.so.com), Yahoo! China , Microsoft 's Bing and MSN Messenger , Sina , NetEase 's Youdao and PaiPai, Alibaba 's Taobao , TOM Online , DuckDuckGo , and EachNet . Baidu is the most used search engine in China, controlling 76.05 percent of China's market share. The number of Internet users in China had reached 705 million by the end of 2015, according to a report by the internetlivestats.com. [ 79 ] In an August 2010 Wall Street Journal article, [ 80 ] Baidu played down its benefit from Google 's having moved its China search service to Hong Kong , but Baidu's share of revenue in China's search-advertising market grew six percentage points in the second quarter to 70%, according to Beijing-based research firm Analysys International. It is also evident that Baidu is attempting to enter the Internet social network market. As of 2011 [update] , it is discussing the possibility of working with Facebook, which would lead to a Chinese version of the international social network, managed by Baidu. [ 81 ] This plan, if executed, would face off Baidu with competition from the three popular Chinese social networks Qzone , Renren [ 82 ] and Kaixin001 [ 83 ] as well as induce rivalry with instant-messaging giant, Tencent QQ . [ 84 ] On 22 February 2012, Hudong submitted a complaint to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce asking for a review of the behavior of Baidu, accusing it of being monopolistic. [ 85 ] By August 2014, Baidu's search market share in China dropped to 56.3%, where Qihoo 360, its closest competitor who has rebranded its search engine as so.com, has increased its market share to 29.0%, according to report from CNZZ.com. [ 86 ] In February 2015, Baidu was alleged to have used anticompetitive tactics in Brazil against the Brazilian online security firm PSafe and Qihoo 360 (the largest investor of PSafe). [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In an ongoing competition in AI natural language processing called General Language Understanding Evaluation , otherwise known as GLUE, Baidu took a lead over Microsoft and Google in December 2019. [ 89 ] Research and patents [ edit ] Baidu has started to invest in deep learning research and is integrating new deep learning technology into some of its apps and products, including Phoenix Nest. Phoenix Nest is Baidu's ad-bidding platform. [ 90 ] In April 2012 Baidu JDC long live applied for a patent for its \"DNA copyright recognition\" technology. This technology automatically scans files that are uploaded by Internet users, and recognizes and filters out content that may violate copyright law. This allows Baidu to offer an infringement-free platform. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] In April 2022, Baidu announced they gained permits from China to provide the first driverless taxis. The company aim to provide driverless ride-hailing services to the public and have 10 autonomous cars set to begin offering rides to passengers within a 23-square-mile area in suburban begin beginning 28 April 2022. [ 93 ] In July 2022, Baidu unveiled the Apollo RT6 , a driverless vehicle that is planned to join Baidu's driverless fleet in 2023. [ 94 ] Censorship [ edit ] According to the China Digital Times , Baidu has a long history of being the most active and restrictive online censor in the search arena. Documents leaked in April 2009 from an employee in Baidu's internal monitoring and censorship department show a long list of blocked websites and censored topics on Baidu search. [ 95 ] In May 2011, activists sued Baidu in the United States for violating the U.S. Constitution by the censorship it conducts in accord with the demand of the Chinese government. [ 96 ] A U.S. judge has ruled [ 97 ] that the Chinese search engine Baidu has the right to block works from its query results under freedom of speech rights, dismissing a lawsuit that sought to punish the company. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] In 2017, Baidu began coordinating with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security as well as 372 Internet police departments to detect information related to \"anti-government rumors\" and then flooding \"Baidu-linked web sites, news sites and devices with alerts dispelling misinformation.\" [ 100 ] This was done using natural language processing , big data and artificial intelligence. [ 100 ] As part of the COVID-19 pandemic , Chinese regulators instructed Baidu, along with other Internet companies, to \"conduct special supervision\" on news and information related to the disease . [ 101 ] In November 2022, Sustainalytics downgraded Baidu to \"non-compliant\" with the United Nations Global Compact principles due to complicity with censorship. [ 102 ] Controversies [ edit ] Main article: Criticisms of Baidu Death of Wei Zexi [ edit ] Main article: Death of Wei Zexi In 2016, Baidu's P4P search results reportedly contributed to the death of a student who tried an experimental cancer therapy he found online. The 21-year-old college student was named Wèi Zéxī (魏则西), who studied in Xidian University . Wei was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma , a rare form of cancer. He found the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps (武警北京市总队第二医院) through the search engine Baidu, on which the hospital had been promoting itself. [ 103 ] The treatment proved unsuccessful and Wèi died in April 2016. [ 103 ] After Wei's family spent around 200,000 yuan (around US$31,150) for treatment in the hospital, Wei Zexi died on 12 April 2016. The incident triggered massive online discussions after Wei's death. [ 104 ] On 2 May 2016, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the top watchdog for China's Internet space, dispatched a team of investigators to Baidu. [ 105 ] The case is still ongoing. One report claimed medical advertising makes up for 30% of Baidu's ad revenue, much of which comes from for-profit hospitals that belong to the \"Putian Network\", a collection of hospitals across the country founded by medical entrepreneurs associated with the Putian region of Fujian province. [ 106 ] The investigation led Chinese regulators to impose several restrictions on Baidu, including adding disclaimers to promotional content and establishing channels for complaints about Baidu services. [ 107 ] In addition, Baidu's search function now largely directs users to contents published on platforms under Baidu's control, leading Chinese media scholar Fang Kecheng to proclaim that \"Search engine Baidu is dead\". [ 108 ] Commercialization of Tieba [ edit ] Baidu sold the hemophilia online community, one of the communities of Tieba , to unqualified hospitals. In January 2016, Baidu announced that it will stop selling all of its illness-related Tieba. [ 109 ] On 12 January, Baidu officially announced to the public that all Baidu Tieba for all types of diseases will completely stop commercial cooperation and will only be open to authoritative public welfare organizations. In response to Baidu's decision, Lin Jinlong, president of the Hunan Medical and Health Industry Association, said that private hospitals have entered a period of industry transformation and upgrading, and are neither dependent on posting bar ads nor counting on competitive rankings anymore, so Baidu's decision will not have a negative impact on the industry. [ 110 ] DO Global subsidiary ad-fraud in downloaded apps [ edit ] On 20 April 2019, it was reported that several applications for Android devices developed by the subsidiary company, DO Global (formerly DU Group), were surreptitiously running revenue enhancing background programs on user devices since at least 2016. [ 111 ] These programs, part of six known applications developed by the company, and downloaded hundreds of millions times, were clicking on internet ads – even when the devices were idle, and unbeknownst to end users , to increase revenue generated by \"clicks\" . [ 111 ] Just one of the apps, all of which were available on Google Play Store , had been downloaded 50 million times alone and carried a user rating of 4.5 stars by tens of thousands. [ 111 ] Google banned DO Global and more than 100 of its apps from the Google Play Store on 26 April 2019. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] DO Global was also banned from Google's AdMob Network. [ 112 ] Apps from another developer, ES Global, including the ES File Explorer , that were owned by DO Global were banned from the Play Store and the account was suspended. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] [ 120 ] Block in India [ edit ] In August 2020, following the 2020 China–India skirmishes , Baidu was one of several Chinese websites that were banned or blocked in India for national security reasons. [ 121 ] 2024 head of communications controversy [ edit ] In May 2024, Baidu's former vice president and head of communications Qu Jing [ zh ] ( Chinese : 璩静 ) sparked major backlashes across the Chinese social media for endorsing toxic workplace culture, where, according to a Douyin video, she has asked a coworker to be on a 50-day business trip during the COVID-19 pandemic . [ 122 ] The report has aroused further discussions amongst Chinese netizens regarding Baidu's corporate governance and internal culture. Qu openly apologized after the incident and has allegedly lost her job. Baidu’s stock price fell 2.17% in Hong Kong following the incident.

Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation , an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers. [ 2 ] Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Initially available only in English , Wikipedia exists in over 340 languages and is the world's ninth most visited website . The English Wikipedia , with over 7 million articles , remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 65 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024 [update] . [ W 1 ] As of May 2025 [update] , over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic comes from the United States, while Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany and Russia each account for around 5%. [ needs update ] [ 5 ] Wikipedia has been praised for enabling the democratization of knowledge , its extensive coverage, unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on a wide variety of topics, but the encyclopedia has also been criticized for systemic bias , such as a gender bias against women and a geographical bias against the Global South . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward. [ 3 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for up-to-date information about those events. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] History Main article: History of Wikipedia Nupedia Main article: Nupedia Wikipedia founders Jimmy Wales Larry Sanger Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success. [ 14 ] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. [ 15 ] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis , a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger , editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. [ 1 ] [ 16 ] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman . [ W 2 ] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia, [ 17 ] [ W 3 ] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal. [ W 4 ] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia. [ W 5 ] Launch and rapid growth Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 (referred to as Wikipedia Day ) [ 18 ] as a single English language edition with the domain name www.wikipedia.com , [ W 6 ] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. [ 17 ] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Its integral policy of \" neutral point of view \" arose within its first year. [ 21 ] Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia. [ 17 ] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business. [ 22 ] The Wikipedia home page on December 20, 2001 [ d ] Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004. [ W 7 ] [ W 8 ] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years. [ 23 ] Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002. [ W 9 ] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org . [ 24 ] [ W 10 ] After an early period of exponential growth, [ 25 ] the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007. [ 26 ] The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800. [ W 11 ] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to \"increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits\". [ 25 ] Others suggested that the growth flattened naturally because articles that could be called \" low-hanging fruit \"—topics that clearly merit an article—had already been created and built up extensively. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend. [ 32 ] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology. [ 33 ] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\". [ 34 ] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae. [ 35 ] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline. [ 36 ] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\" [ 37 ] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Sister projects Main article: Wikimedia project Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation . These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary , a dictionary project launched in December 2002, [ W 12 ] Wikiquote , a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, [ 40 ] Wikibooks , a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, [ W 13 ] Wikimedia Commons , a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, [ W 14 ] Wikinews , for collaborative journalism, [ W 15 ] and Wikiversity , a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities. [ W 16 ] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies , is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing. [ 41 ] In 2012, Wikivoyage , an editable travel guide, [ 42 ] and Wikidata , an editable knowledge base, launched. [ W 17 ] Milestones Cartogram showing number of articles in each language as of March 2024. [update] Languages with fewer than 1,000,000 articles are represented by one circle. Languages are grouped by region of continent and each region of continent is presented by a separate color. In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks. [ 43 ] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked ninth, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11). [ 43 ] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors. [ 44 ] In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month. [ W 18 ] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\". [ 45 ] As of March 2023 [update] , it ranked sixth in popularity, according to Similarweb . [ 46 ] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \" stigmergic accumulation\". [ 47 ] [ 48 ] On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress —the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours . [ 49 ] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content. [ 50 ] [ W 19 ] In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia , an asteroid , was named after Wikipedia; [ 51 ] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument ; [ 52 ] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia . [ 53 ] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander , Beresheet , crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA . [ 56 ] On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.\" [ 57 ] Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\" [ 57 ] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky , associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\" [ 57 ] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally. [ 58 ] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals, [ 59 ] from which cloud computing was the most cited page. [ 60 ] On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called \"Vector 2022\". [ 61 ] [ 62 ] It featured a redesigned menu bar , moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar , and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool. [ 62 ] [ W 20 ] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes. [ 61 ] [ 63 ] Collaborative editing Differences between versions of an article are highlighted. Restrictions Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article. [ W 21 ] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees. [ 64 ] A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it. [ 65 ] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes. [ W 22 ] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"perhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\". [ 66 ] Wikipedia has delegated some functions to bots . Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors. [ 67 ] Bots must be approved by the community before their tasks are implemented. [ 68 ] In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains \"stable versions\" of articles which have passed certain reviews. [ W 23 ] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012. [ 69 ] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published. [ 70 ] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversify the editing community. [ 71 ] Articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are placed under extended-confirmed protection. [ 72 ] Editors also can make only one revert per day across the entire field and can be banned from editing related articles. These restrictions were introduced in 2008. [ 73 ] In January 2025, the Arbitration Committee introduced the \"balanced editing restriction\", which requires sanctioned users to devote only a third of their edits to articles related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict even when no misconduct rules have been violated. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Review of changes Wikipedia's editing interface Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision. [ e ] [ 76 ] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes. [ W 24 ] \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems. [ W 25 ] In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\". [ 77 ] Vandalism Main article: Vandalism on Wikipedia Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam. [ 78 ] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively. [ W 26 ] American journalist John Seigenthaler (1927–2014), subject of the Seigenthaler biography incident Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair. [ 81 ] In the Seigenthaler biography incident , an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy . [ 81 ] It remained uncorrected for four months. [ 81 ] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University , called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\". [ 81 ] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people. [ 84 ] Disputes and edit warring Main article: Disputes on Wikipedia Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\". [ W 27 ] [ 85 ] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added, [ 86 ] and criticized as creating a competitive [ 87 ] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles . [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes, [ 90 ] [ 91 ] the influence of rival editing camps, [ 92 ] [ 93 ] the conversational structure, [ 94 ] and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on \"mutually reverting edit pairs\", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush , anarchism , and Muhammad . [ 98 ] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia , Scientology , and 9/11 conspiracy theories . [ 98 ] In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia. [ 96 ] Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia , with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies. [ 99 ] Policies and content \"Five pillars of Wikipedia\" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, see Wikipedia:Five pillars . External videos Jimmy Wales , The Birth of Wikipedia, 2006, TED talks , 20 minutes Katherine Maher , What Wikipedia Teaches Us About Balancing Truth and Beliefs, 2022, TED talks , 15 minutes Wikipedia is composed of 11 different namespaces , with its articles being present in mainspace . Other namespaces have a prefix before their page title and fulfill various purposes. For example, the project namespace uses the Wikipedia prefix and is used for self-governance related discussions. Most readers are not aware of these other namespaces. [ 100 ] The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content. [ W 28 ] The five pillars are: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility Wikipedia has no firm rules The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus. [ 101 ] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent. [ W 23 ] Content policies and guidelines \"No original research\" redirects here. For the Wikipedia policy, see Wikipedia:No original research . According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style. [ W 29 ] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of \"notability\" , which generally means that the topic has been covered extensively in reliable sources that are independent of the article's subject. [ 102 ] Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized and therefore must not present original research. [ 103 ] Some subjects such as politicians and academics have specialized notability requirements. [ 102 ] Finally, Wikipedia must reflect a neutral point of view. This is accomplished through summarizing reliable sources, using impartial language, and ensuring that multiple points of view are presented based on their prominence. Information must also be verifiable. [ 104 ] Information without citations may be tagged or removed entirely. [ 105 ] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced. [ 106 ] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages. [ 67 ] Governance Further information: Wikipedia:Administration Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article. [ W 30 ] Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights , granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. Some user rights are granted automatically, such as the autoconfirmed and extended confirmed groups, when thresholds for account age and edits are met. [ 65 ] Administrators Main article: Wikipedia administrators Experienced editors can choose to run for \" adminship \", [ 109 ] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes. [ W 31 ] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits. [ W 31 ] By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous. [ 36 ] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship. [ 110 ] Dispute resolution Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\", [ W 27 ] in which bots add the discussion to a centralized list of discussions, invite editors to participate, and remove the discussion from the list after 30 days. [ W 32 ] However, editors have the discretion to close (and delist) the discussion early or late. If the result of a discussion is not obvious, a closer—an uninvolved editor usually in good standing—may render a verdict from the strength of the arguments presented and then the numbers of arguers on each side. [ 111 ] Wikipedians emphasize that the process is not a vote by referring to statements of opinion in such discussions as \"!vote\"s, in which the exclamation mark is the symbol for logical negation and pronounced \"not\". [ 112 ] Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field. [ 113 ] Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers . [ 113 ] : 62 A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings. [ 113 ] : 83 Arbitration Committee Main article: Arbitration Committee (Wikipedia) The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. [ 114 ] Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted, [ 115 ] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. [ 114 ] Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased). [ f ] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). [ 114 ] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and antisocial behavior . [ W 33 ] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings. [ 114 ] Community Main article: Wikipedia community Video of Wikimania 2005 – an annual conference for users of Wikipedia and other projects operated by the Wikimedia Foundation , was held in Frankfurt am Main , Germany, August 4–8. Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. [ 116 ] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike , [ 117 ] although not always with entirely negative connotations. [ 118 ] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials , has been referred to as \" anti-elitism \". [ W 34 ] Wikipedians and British Museum curators collaborate on the article Hoxne Hoard in June 2010. Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. [ 119 ] As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. [ 120 ] Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". [ 121 ] Since Wikipedia relies on volunteer labour, editors frequently focus on topics that interest them. [ 122 ] The English Wikipedia has 7,054,632 articles, 49,661,782 registered editors, and 111,223 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days. [ W 35 ] Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\". [ 123 ] Editors who do not log in are in some sense \" second-class citizens \" on Wikipedia, [ 123 ] as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\", [ 124 ] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty. [ 124 ] New editors often struggle to understand Wikipedia's complexity. Experienced editors are encouraged to not \"bite\" the newcomers in order to create a more welcoming atmosphere. [ 125 ] Research A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\". [ 126 ] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\" [ 121 ] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\". [ 121 ] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that \"one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\" [ 127 ] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz , who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts. [ 128 ] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others, [ 129 ] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small. [ 130 ] According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\". [ 131 ] Diversity Several studies have shown that most volunteer Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female. [ 132 ] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors. [ 133 ] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown , gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology. [ 133 ] Andrew Lih , a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\". [ 134 ] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors. [ 135 ] Language editions Main article: List of Wikipedias Distribution of the 65,484,285 articles in different language editions (as of September 11, 2025) [ W 36 ] English (10.8%) Cebuano (9.30%) German (4.70%) French (4.10%) Swedish (4.00%) Dutch (3.40%) Russian (3.20%) Spanish (3.10%) Italian (3.00%) Polish (2.50%) Egyptian Arabic (2.50%) Chinese (2.30%) Japanese (2.20%) Ukrainian (2.10%) Vietnamese (2.00%) Arabic (2.00%) Waray (1.90%) Portuguese (1.90%) Persian (1.60%) Catalan (1.20%) Other (32.2%) There are currently 343 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions , or simply Wikipedias ). As of September 2025, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English , Cebuano , German , French , Swedish , and Dutch Wikipedias. [ W 37 ] The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot , which as of 2013 [update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia , and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias . The latter are both languages of the Philippines . In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each ( Russian , Spanish , Italian , Polish , Egyptian Arabic , Chinese , Japanese , Ukrainian , Vietnamese , Arabic , Waray , and Portuguese ), seven more have over 500,000 articles ( Persian , Catalan , Indonesian , Korean , Serbian , Norwegian , and Turkish ), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000. [ W 38 ] [ W 37 ] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 7 million articles. As of January 2021, [update] the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic. [ W 39 ] Most viewed editions of Wikipedia, 2008–2024 Most edited editions of Wikipedia, 2001–2024 Articles in the 20 largest language editions of Wikipedia (as of 11 September 2025) [ 136 ] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 English 7,054,632 Cebuano 6,116,087 German 3,049,117 French 2,708,494 Swedish 2,615,951 Dutch 2,196,677 Russian 2,062,844 Spanish 2,060,071 Italian 1,934,538 Polish 1,668,267 Egyptian Arabic 1,628,844 Chinese 1,499,402 Japanese 1,472,513 Ukrainian 1,390,394 Vietnamese 1,296,322 Arabic 1,279,352 Waray 1,266,765 Portuguese 1,155,032 Persian 1,053,796 Catalan 780,809 Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color ) [ W 40 ] or points of view. [ W 41 ] Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use . [ W 42 ] [ 137 ] Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\". [ W 43 ] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others). [ W 44 ] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia, [ W 45 ] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have. [ W 46 ] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics. [ W 46 ] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects. [ W 47 ] Estimation of contributions shares from different regions in the world to different Wikipedia editions [ 138 ] Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions. [ 139 ] [ W 48 ] A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia . [ 138 ] English Wikipedia editor numbers On March 1, 2014, The Economist , in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\" [ 140 ] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014. [ 140 ] In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia. [ 140 ] Reception See also: Academic studies about Wikipedia , Criticism of Wikipedia , and Racial bias on Wikipedia Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation , which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014. [update] [ 141 ] [ 113 ] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias . In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\". [ 142 ] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's \" undue-weight policy \", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information. [ 143 ] [ 144 ] [ 145 ] Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic. [ 142 ] [ 146 ] A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin . [ 147 ] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\" [ 148 ] Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased . In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much \" leftist bias\". [ 149 ] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a \"propaganda\" for the left-leaning \"establishment\" and warned the site can no longer be trusted. [ 150 ] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics. [ 151 ] Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a \"western cultural bias \" (or \"pro-western bias\") [ 152 ] or \"Eurocentric bias\", [ 153 ] reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, \"similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography\". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship [ 154 ] and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a \"decolonization\" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors. [ 155 ] Accuracy of content Main article: Reliability of Wikipedia External audio The Great Book of Knowledge, Part 1 , Ideas with Paul Kennedy , CBC , January 15, 2014 Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts , lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy. [ 156 ] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica , about three.\" [ 157 ] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\" [ 158 ] Others raised similar critiques. [ 159 ] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica , [ 160 ] [ 161 ] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica . [ 162 ] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in Nature ' s manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals ), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small sample size , 42 or 4 × 10 1 articles compared, vs >10 5 and >10 6 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively). [ 163 ] As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it. [ W 49 ] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information, [ 164 ] vandalism , and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\". [ 165 ] Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them. [ 166 ] Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\". [ 167 ] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: \"There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is].\" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica , summarizing that \"...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.\" [ 168 ] Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable. [ 169 ] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear. [ 170 ] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia. [ 171 ] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles. [ 172 ] External videos Inside Wikipedia – Attack of the PR Industry , Deutsche Welle , 7:13 mins [ 173 ] Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls , spammers , and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia. [ 76 ] [ W 50 ] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing. [ 174 ] The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher , the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia. ' \" [ 174 ] [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report . [ 179 ] Discouragement in education Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work , preferring primary sources ; [ 180 ] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative. [ 183 ] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia\", he said. [ 184 ] In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi , although without realizing the articles might change. [ 185 ] In June 2007, Michael Gorman , former president of the American Library Association , condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\". [ 186 ] A 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education \" flipped classroom \", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education. [ 187 ] Medical information See also: Health information on Wikipedia On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\" [ 188 ] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues , as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process. [ 188 ] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\" [ 189 ] Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\" [ 189 ] Coverage of topics and systemic bias See also: Notability in the English Wikipedia and Criticism of Wikipedia § Systemic bias in coverage Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space , it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia. [ W 51 ] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism ). [ 190 ] [ 191 ] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic. [ W 52 ] The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy. [ 192 ] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China [ 193 ] and Pakistan, [ 194 ] among other countries. [ 195 ] [ 196 ] [ 197 ] Through its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles. [ 198 ] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\". [ 199 ] An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers . [ 200 ] Systemic biases Wikipedia's policies may limit \"its capacity for truly representing global knowledge\". For example, Wikipedia only considers published sources to be reliable. Oral knowledge of Indigenous cultures is not always reflected in print. Marginalized topics are also more likely to lack significant coverage in reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is therefore limited as a result of larger systemic biases. [ 201 ] Academic studies of Wikipedia have shown that the average contributor to the English Wikipedia is an educated, technically inclined white male, aged 15–49, from a developed, predominantly Christian country. [ 202 ] The corresponding point of view (POV) is over-represented. [ 203 ] [ 154 ] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias , gender bias , and geographical bias on Wikipedia . [ 204 ] [ 205 ] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references). [ 203 ] Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view . [ 204 ] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\". [ 34 ] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors . [ 35 ] Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, with Africa being the most underrepresented. [ 206 ] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events. [ 207 ] Explicit content See also: Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia and Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons For the government censorship of Wikipedia, see Censorship of Wikipedia . For Wikipedia's policy concerning censorship, see Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not censored Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content. [ 208 ] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces , cadaver , human penis , vulva , and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children. [ W 53 ] The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation , illustrations of zoophilia , and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children . [ W 54 ] The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer —a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions —features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers. [ 209 ] In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law . [ 210 ] [ 211 ] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon , were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the PROTECT Act of 2003 . [ 212 ] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law . [ 212 ] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools. [ 213 ] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation, [ 214 ] saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\" [ 214 ] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\". [ 215 ] Critics, including Wikipediocracy , noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared. [ 216 ] Privacy One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia regards one's right to remain a private citizen rather than a public figure in the eyes of the law. [ 217 ] [ g ] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life . The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, \"we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement\", and states that \"personal information\" may be shared \"For legal reasons\", \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others\", or \"To Understand & Experiment\". [ W 55 ] In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic , aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated. [ 218 ] Wikipedia has a \" Volunteer Response Team \" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS [ W 56 ] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project. [ W 57 ] In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the UK's Online Safety Bill legislation. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers. [ 219 ] Sexism Main article: Gender bias on Wikipedia Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment . [ 220 ] [ 221 ] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship. [ 222 ] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics. [ 223 ] In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media. [ W 58 ] [ 224 ] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou . [ 224 ] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that \"it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.\" [ 226 ] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage. [ 226 ] A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University 's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\" [ 227 ] Operation Wikimedia Foundation and affiliate movements Main article: Wikimedia Foundation Katherine Maher , the third executive director of Wikimedia, served from 2016 to 2021. Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation , a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks . [ W 59 ] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission. [ 228 ] [ W 60 ] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million. [ W 61 ] In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner. [ W 62 ] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background, from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\" [ 229 ] [ 230 ] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue ( paid advocacy ) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities\", Walsh said. [ 229 ] Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted, [ W 63 ] Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016. [ W 64 ] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.\" [ 134 ] Maher served as executive director until April 2021. [ 231 ] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community. [ 232 ] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates . These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia. [ W 65 ] Software operations and support See also: MediaWiki The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki , a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system. [ W 66 ] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language , variables , a transclusion system for templates , and URL redirection . [ W 67 ] MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects. [ W 66 ] [ W 68 ] Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. [ W 69 ] Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske . The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker . Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software. [ W 70 ] In April 2005, a Lucene extension [ W 71 ] [ W 72 ] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch . [ W 73 ] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor , was opened to public use. [ 233 ] [ 234 ] [ 235 ] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\". [ 236 ] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward. [ W 74 ] Automated editing Main article: Wikipedia bots Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data. [ W 75 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson , created articles with his bot Lsjbot , which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days. [ 239 ] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses). [ W 76 ] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly. [ 237 ] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government. [ 240 ] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation. [ W 77 ] According to Andrew Lih , the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots. [ 241 ] Hardware operations and support Overview of system architecture as of August 2022 [update] As of 2021, [update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server . [ W 78 ] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database. [ W 78 ] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses. [ 242 ] Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system. [ W 79 ] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia . [ W 80 ] [ 243 ] In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore , the first of its kind in Asia. [ W 81 ] In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille , France. [ W 82 ] In 2024, a caching data center was opened in São Paulo , the first of its kind in South America. [ W 83 ] As of November 2024, [update] caching clusters are located in Amsterdam , San Francisco, Singapore, Marseille, and São Paulo. [ W 84 ] [ W 85 ] Internal research and operational development Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits, [ 35 ] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation. [ 244 ] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the \"Thank\" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition. [ 35 ] [ 236 ] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe , who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment. [ 245 ] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars, [ W 86 ] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually. [ 245 ] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually, [ W 87 ] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually. [ 245 ] Internal news publications Main article: The Signpost Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia 's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008. [ 246 ] [ 247 ] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects . [ W 88 ] The Wikipedia Library For information for Wikipedia editors, see Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library . Wikipedia Library Wikipedia editors sometimes struggle to access paywalled sources needed to improve a subject. [ 248 ] The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications , so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia. [ 249 ] [ 250 ] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\" [ 251 ] Access to content \"Accessing Wikipedia\" redirects here. For our accessibility guidelines, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility . Content licensing When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work. [ W 89 ] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL . This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. [ 252 ] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons. [ W 90 ] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009. [ W 91 ] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009. [ W 92 ] [ W 93 ] [ W 94 ] [ W 95 ] The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine, [ W 96 ] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law ). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons ' CC BY-SA ) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. [ W 97 ] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text. [ 253 ] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France. [ 254 ] [ 255 ] Methods of access Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge. [ W 98 ] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website. Thousands of \" mirror sites \" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com . [ 256 ] [ 257 ] Another example is Wapedia , which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did. [ W 99 ] Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset ) [ 258 ] and DuckDuckGo . Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs . An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles. [ W 100 ] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles, [ W 101 ] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles, [ W 102 ] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles. [ W 103 ] Additionally, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children , is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen. [ W 104 ] There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form. [ 259 ] [ W 105 ] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM . [ 260 ] The website DBpedia , begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia. [ 261 ] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF . [ W 106 ] As of February 2023, [update] it has over 101 million items. [ W 107 ] WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009. [ W 108 ] Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged. [ W 109 ] Wikipedia publishes \" dumps \" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023, [update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images. [ W 110 ] Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this. [ 262 ] Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation , the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk , with an accuracy of 55 percent. [ 263 ] Mobile access See also: List of Wikipedia mobile applications and Help:Mobile access A mobile version showing the English Wikipedia's Main Page on October 2, 2024 Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection . Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller , deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment. [ 45 ] By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees. [ 2 ] Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service. [ W 99 ] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone , Android -based devices, or WebOS -based devices. [ W 111 ] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation . [ 264 ] [ 265 ] The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google. [ W 112 ] [ W 113 ] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews. [ W 114 ] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access. [ W 115 ] [ 266 ] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators. [ W 115 ] Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors. [ 267 ] [ 268 ] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years, [ 267 ] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo. [ 35 ] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it. [ 267 ] [ 268 ] Chinese access Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015. [ 7 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult. [ 271 ] Cultural influence Trusted source to combat fake news In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news. [ 272 ] [ 273 ] Noam Cohen , writing in The Washington Post states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out ' fake news '.\" [ 273 ] [ 274 ] Readership In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\" [ 45 ] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping. [ 58 ] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022. [ 58 ] In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles, [ W 116 ] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001. [ 275 ] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009. [ W 117 ] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia. [ 276 ] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements. [ 277 ] According to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization. [ W 118 ] As of February 2023, [update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month. [ W 1 ] COVID-19 pandemic Main article: Wikipedia coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic During the COVID-19 pandemic , Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall. [ 278 ] [ 279 ] [ 280 ] [ 281 ] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, \"Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.\" [ 279 ] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects. [ 282 ] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021. [update] [ 283 ] [ 284 ] Cultural significance Main article: Wikipedia in culture Wikipedia Monument in Słubice , Poland, by Mihran Hakobyan (2014) Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases. [ W 119 ] [ 285 ] [ 286 ] The Parliament of Canada 's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the Civil Marriage Act . [ 287 ] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization [ 288 ] —though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case. [ 289 ] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports. [ 290 ] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia. [ 291 ] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism, [ 292 ] [ 293 ] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia . [ 294 ] [ 295 ] [ 296 ] [ 297 ] In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit , MySpace , and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide. [ 298 ] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign , saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\" [ 299 ] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability. [ 300 ] One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama . He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues. [ 301 ] Wikipedia, an introduction – Erasmus Prize 2015 Jimmy Wales accepts the 2008 Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award on behalf of Wikipedia. A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford -based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence ) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth\". [ 302 ] [ 303 ] In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired , Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web \" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services , the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \" sapere aude \" ( lit. ' dare to know ' ), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\" [ 304 ] Awards Wikipedia team visiting the Parliament of Asturias Wikipedians meeting after the 2015 Asturias awards ceremony Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004. [ W 120 ] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the \"community\" category. [ 305 ] In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in response to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\" [ 306 ] In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić , Eckart Höfling , and Peter Gabriel . The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger . [ 307 ] In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize , which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences, [ 308 ] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation. [ 309 ] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users. [ 310 ] Satire See also: Category:Parodies of Wikipedia Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality , meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\". [ 179 ] Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion , [ 311 ] as well as the 2010 The Onion article \" 'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\". [ 312 ] In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office , office manager ( Michael Scott ) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. [ 313 ] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page. [ 314 ] \" My Number One Doctor \", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs , played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide . [ 315 ] In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements. [ 316 ] The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\" [ 317 ] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia , which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia. [ 318 ] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles. [ 319 ] On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\" [ 320 ] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman . [ 321 ] In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title \"Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday\" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level. [ 322 ] Publishing A group of Wikimedians of the Wikimedia DC chapter at the 2013 DC Wikimedia annual meeting standing in front of the Encyclopædia Britannica (back left) at the US National Archives The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica , which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free. [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Nicholas Carr 's 2005 essay \"The amorality of Web 2.0 \" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\" [ 326 ] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson , the former editor-in-chief of Wired , wrote in Nature that the \" wisdom of crowds \" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes. [ 327 ] Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\". [ 328 ] Kathryn Hughes , professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\" [ 328 ] Research use Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics , information retrieval and natural language processing . [ 329 ] [ 330 ] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called \"wikification\", [ 331 ] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation . [ 332 ] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia. [ 333 ] In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations. [ 334 ] [ 335 ] [ 336 ] They used PageRank , CheiRank and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\". [ 336 ] [ 337 ] The study was updated in 2019. [ 338 ] In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had \"never caught it out\". He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it. [ 339 ] A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used in Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications. [ 340 ] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence [ 303 ] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism [ 341 ] [ 342 ] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia. [ 343 ] [ 344 ] In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history . [ 345 ] Related projects Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project , which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008. [ 346 ] Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2 ), [ 347 ] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE ). [ W 121 ] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2 , which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative. [ 348 ] Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review , such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium . [ 349 ] [ 350 ] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.

There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry \"censorship\", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

For the search engine, see WebCrawler . \"Web spider\" redirects here; not to be confused with Spider web . \"Spiderbot\" redirects here. For the video game, see Arac (video game) . Architecture of a Web crawler Web crawler , sometimes called a spider or spiderbot and often shortened to crawler , is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web and that is typically operated by search engines for the purpose of Web indexing ( web spidering ). [ 1 ] Web search engines and some other websites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indices of other sites' web content. Web crawlers copy pages for processing by a search engine, which indexes the downloaded pages so that users can search more efficiently. Crawlers consume resources on visited systems and often visit sites unprompted. Issues of schedule, load, and \"politeness\" come into play when large collections of pages are accessed. Mechanisms exist for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent. For example, including a robots.txt file can request bots to index only parts of a website, or nothing at all. The number of Internet pages is extremely large; even the largest crawlers fall short of making a complete index. For this reason, search engines struggled to give relevant search results in the early years of the World Wide Web, before 2000. Today, relevant results are given almost instantly. Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and HTML code. They can also be used for web scraping and data-driven programming . Nomenclature [ edit ] A web crawler is also known as a spider , [ 2 ] an ant , an automatic indexer , [ 3 ] or (in the FOAF software context) a Web scutter . [ 4 ] Overview [ edit ] A Web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit. Those first URLs are called the seeds . As the crawler visits these URLs, by communicating with web servers that respond to those URLs, it identifies all the hyperlinks in the retrieved web pages and adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier . URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies. If the crawler is performing archiving of websites (or web archiving ), it copies and saves the information as it goes. The archives are usually stored in such a way they can be viewed, read and navigated as if they were on the live web, but are preserved as 'snapshots'. [ 5 ] The archive is known as the repository and is designed to store and manage the collection of web pages . The repository only stores HTML pages and these pages are stored as distinct files. A repository is similar to any other system that stores data, like a modern-day database. The only difference is that a repository does not need all the functionality offered by a database system. The repository stores the most recent version of the web page retrieved by the crawler. [ citation needed ] The large volume implies the crawler can only download a limited number of the Web pages within a given time, so it needs to prioritize its downloads. The high rate of change can imply the pages might have already been updated or even deleted. The number of possible URLs crawled being generated by server-side software has also made it difficult for web crawlers to avoid retrieving duplicate content . Endless combinations of HTTP GET (URL-based) parameters exist, of which only a small selection will actually return unique content. For example, a simple online photo gallery may offer three options to users, as specified through HTTP GET parameters in the URL. If there exist four ways to sort images, three choices of thumbnail size, two file formats, and an option to disable user-provided content, then the same set of content can be accessed with 48 different URLs, all of which may be linked on the site. This mathematical combination creates a problem for crawlers, as they must sort through endless combinations of relatively minor scripted changes in order to retrieve unique content. As Edwards et al. noted, \"Given that the bandwidth for conducting crawls is neither infinite nor free, it is becoming essential to crawl the Web in not only a scalable, but efficient way, if some reasonable measure of quality or freshness is to be maintained.\" [ 6 ] A crawler must carefully choose at each step which pages to visit next. Crawling policy [ edit ] The behavior of a Web crawler is the outcome of a combination of policies: [ 7 ] a selection policy which states the pages to download, a re-visit policy which states when to check for changes to the pages, a politeness policy that states how to avoid overloading websites . a parallelization policy that states how to coordinate distributed web crawlers. Selection policy [ edit ] Given the current size of the Web, even large search engines cover only a portion of the publicly available part. A 2009 study showed even large-scale search engines index no more than 40–70% of the indexable Web; [ 8 ] a previous study by Steve Lawrence and Lee Giles showed that no search engine indexed more than 16% of the Web in 1999. [ 9 ] As a crawler always downloads just a fraction of the Web pages , it is highly desirable for the downloaded fraction to contain the most relevant pages and not just a random sample of the Web. This requires a metric of importance for prioritizing Web pages. The importance of a page is a function of its intrinsic quality, its popularity in terms of links or visits, and even of its URL (the latter is the case of vertical search engines restricted to a single top-level domain , or search engines restricted to a fixed Web site). Designing a good selection policy has an added difficulty: it must work with partial information, as the complete set of Web pages is not known during crawling. Junghoo Cho et al. made the first study on policies for crawling scheduling. Their data set was a 180,000-pages crawl from the stanford.edu domain, in which a crawling simulation was done with different strategies. [ 10 ] The ordering metrics tested were breadth-first , backlink count and partial PageRank calculations. One of the conclusions was that if the crawler wants to download pages with high Pagerank early during the crawling process, then the partial Pagerank strategy is the better, followed by breadth-first and backlink-count. However, these results are for just a single domain. Cho also wrote his PhD dissertation at Stanford on web crawling. [ 11 ] Najork and Wiener performed an actual crawl on 328 million pages, using breadth-first ordering. [ 12 ] They found that a breadth-first crawl captures pages with high Pagerank early in the crawl (but they did not compare this strategy against other strategies). The explanation given by the authors for this result is that \"the most important pages have many links to them from numerous hosts, and those links will be found early, regardless of on which host or page the crawl originates.\" Abiteboul designed a crawling strategy based on an algorithm called OPIC (On-line Page Importance Computation). [ 13 ] In OPIC, each page is given an initial sum of \"cash\" that is distributed equally among the pages it points to. It is similar to a PageRank computation, but it is faster and is only done in one step. An OPIC-driven crawler downloads first the pages in the crawling frontier with higher amounts of \"cash\". Experiments were carried in a 100,000-pages synthetic graph with a power-law distribution of in-links. However, there was no comparison with other strategies nor experiments in the real Web. Boldi et al. used simulation on subsets of the Web of 40 million pages from the .it domain and 100 million pages from the WebBase crawl, testing breadth-first against depth-first, random ordering and an omniscient strategy. The comparison was based on how well PageRank computed on a partial crawl approximates the true PageRank value. Some visits that accumulate PageRank very quickly (most notably, breadth-first and the omniscient visit) provide very poor progressive approximations. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Baeza-Yates et al. used simulation on two subsets of the Web of 3 million pages from the .gr and .cl domain, testing several crawling strategies. [ 16 ] They showed that both the OPIC strategy and a strategy that uses the length of the per-site queues are better than breadth-first crawling, and that it is also very effective to use a previous crawl, when it is available, to guide the current one. Daneshpajouh et al. designed a community based algorithm for discovering good seeds. [ 17 ] Their method crawls web pages with high PageRank from different communities in less iteration in comparison with crawl starting from random seeds. One can extract good seed from a previously-crawled-Web graph using this new method. Using these seeds, a new crawl can be very effective. Restricting followed links [ edit ] A crawler may only want to seek out HTML pages and avoid all other MIME types . In order to request only HTML resources, a crawler may make an HTTP HEAD request to determine a Web resource's MIME type before requesting the entire resource with a GET request. To avoid making numerous HEAD requests, a crawler may examine the URL and only request a resource if the URL ends with certain characters such as .html, .htm, .asp, .aspx, .php, .jsp, .jspx or a slash. This strategy may cause numerous HTML Web resources to be unintentionally skipped. Some crawlers may also avoid requesting any resources that have a \"?\" in them (are dynamically produced) in order to avoid spider traps that may cause the crawler to download an infinite number of URLs from a Web site. This strategy is unreliable if the site uses URL rewriting to simplify its URLs. URL normalization [ edit ] Main article: URL normalization Crawlers usually perform some type of URL normalization in order to avoid crawling the same resource more than once. The term URL normalization , also called URL canonicalization , refers to the process of modifying and standardizing a URL in a consistent manner. There are several types of normalization that may be performed including conversion of URLs to lowercase, removal of \".\" and \"..\" segments, and adding trailing slashes to the non-empty path component. [ 18 ] Path-ascending crawling [ edit ] Some crawlers intend to download/upload as many resources as possible from a particular web site. So path-ascending crawler was introduced that would ascend to every path in each URL that it intends to crawl. [ 19 ] For example, when given a seed URL of http://llama.org/hamster/monkey/page.html, it will attempt to crawl /hamster/monkey/, /hamster/, and /. Cothey found that a path-ascending crawler was very effective in finding isolated resources, or resources for which no inbound link would have been found in regular crawling. Focused crawling [ edit ] Main article: Focused crawler The importance of a page for a crawler can also be expressed as a function of the similarity of a page to a given query. Web crawlers that attempt to download pages that are similar to each other are called focused crawler or topical crawlers . The concepts of topical and focused crawling were first introduced by Filippo Menczer [ 20 ] [ 21 ] and by Soumen Chakrabarti et al. [ 22 ] The main problem in focused crawling is that in the context of a Web crawler, we would like to be able to predict the similarity of the text of a given page to the query before actually downloading the page. A possible predictor is the anchor text of links; this was the approach taken by Pinkerton [ 23 ] in the first web crawler of the early days of the Web. Diligenti et al. [ 24 ] propose using the complete content of the pages already visited to infer the similarity between the driving query and the pages that have not been visited yet. The performance of a focused crawling depends mostly on the richness of links in the specific topic being searched, and a focused crawling usually relies on a general Web search engine for providing starting points. Academic focused crawler [ edit ] An example of the focused crawlers are academic crawlers, which crawls free-access academic related documents, such as the citeseerxbot , which is the crawler of CiteSeer X search engine. Other academic search engines are Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search etc. Because most academic papers are published in PDF formats, such kind of crawler is particularly interested in crawling PDF, PostScript files, Microsoft Word including their zipped formats. Because of this, general open-source crawlers, such as Heritrix , must be customized to filter out other MIME types , or a middleware is used to extract these documents out and import them to the focused crawl database and repository. [ 25 ] Identifying whether these documents are academic or not is challenging and can add a significant overhead to the crawling process, so this is performed as a post crawling process using machine learning or regular expression algorithms. These academic documents are usually obtained from home pages of faculties and students or from publication page of research institutes. Because academic documents make up only a small fraction of all web pages, a good seed selection is important in boosting the efficiencies of these web crawlers. [ 26 ] Other academic crawlers may download plain text and HTML files, that contains metadata of academic papers, such as titles, papers, and abstracts. This increases the overall number of papers, but a significant fraction may not provide free PDF downloads. Semantic focused crawler [ edit ] Another type of focused crawlers is semantic focused crawler, which makes use of domain ontologies to represent topical maps and link Web pages with relevant ontological concepts for the selection and categorization purposes. [ 27 ] In addition, ontologies can be automatically updated in the crawling process. Dong et al. [ 28 ] introduced such an ontology-learning-based crawler using a support-vector machine to update the content of ontological concepts when crawling Web pages. Re-visit policy [ edit ] The Web has a very dynamic nature, and crawling a fraction of the Web can take weeks or months. By the time a Web crawler has finished its crawl, many events could have happened, including creations, updates, and deletions. From the search engine's point of view, there is a cost associated with not detecting an event, and thus having an outdated copy of a resource. The most-used cost functions are freshness and age. [ 29 ] Freshness : This is a binary measure that indicates whether the local copy is accurate or not. The freshness of a page p in the repository at time t is defined as: F p ( t ) = { 1 i f p i s e q u a l t o t h e l o c a l c o p y a t t i m e t 0 o t h e r w i s e {\\displaystyle F_{p}(t)={\\begin{cases}1&{\\rm {if}}~p~{\\rm {~is~equal~to~the~local~copy~at~time}}~t\\\\0&{\\rm {otherwise}}\\end{cases}}} Age : This is a measure that indicates how outdated the local copy is. The age of a page p in the repository, at time t is defined as: A p ( t ) = { 0 i f p i s n o t m o d i f i e d a t t i m e t t − m o d i f i c a t i o n t i m e o f p o t h e r w i s e {\\displaystyle A_{p}(t)={\\begin{cases}0&{\\rm {if}}~p~{\\rm {~is~not~modified~at~time}}~t\\\\t-{\\rm {modification~time~of}}~p&{\\rm {otherwise}}\\end{cases}}} Coffman et al. worked with a definition of the objective of a Web crawler that is equivalent to freshness, but use a different wording: they propose that a crawler must minimize the fraction of time pages remain outdated. They also noted that the problem of Web crawling can be modeled as a multiple-queue, single-server polling system, on which the Web crawler is the server and the Web sites are the queues. Page modifications are the arrival of the customers, and switch-over times are the interval between page accesses to a single Web site. Under this model, mean waiting time for a customer in the polling system is equivalent to the average age for the Web crawler. [ 30 ] The objective of the crawler is to keep the average freshness of pages in its collection as high as possible, or to keep the average age of pages as low as possible. These objectives are not equivalent: in the first case, the crawler is just concerned with how many pages are outdated, while in the second case, the crawler is concerned with how old the local copies of pages are. Evolution of Freshness and Age in a web crawler Two simple re-visiting policies were studied by Cho and Garcia-Molina: [ 31 ] Uniform policy: This involves re-visiting all pages in the collection with the same frequency, regardless of their rates of change. Proportional policy: This involves re-visiting more often the pages that change more frequently. The visiting frequency is directly proportional to the (estimated) change frequency. In both cases, the repeated crawling order of pages can be done either in a random or a fixed order. Cho and Garcia-Molina proved the surprising result that, in terms of average freshness, the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have a limit to how many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) the freshness of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall freshness time from them. To improve freshness, the crawler should penalize the elements that change too often. [ 32 ] The optimal re-visiting policy is neither the uniform policy nor the proportional policy. The optimal method for keeping average freshness high includes ignoring the pages that change too often, and the optimal for keeping average age low is to use access frequencies that monotonically (and sub-linearly) increase with the rate of change of each page. In both cases, the optimal is closer to the uniform policy than to the proportional policy: as Coffman et al. note, \"in order to minimize the expected obsolescence time, the accesses to any particular page should be kept as evenly spaced as possible\". [ 30 ] Explicit formulas for the re-visit policy are not attainable in general, but they are obtained numerically, as they depend on the distribution of page changes. Cho and Garcia-Molina show that the exponential distribution is a good fit for describing page changes, [ 32 ] while Ipeirotis et al. show how to use statistical tools to discover parameters that affect this distribution. [ 33 ] The re-visiting policies considered here regard all pages as homogeneous in terms of quality (\"all pages on the Web are worth the same\"), something that is not a realistic scenario, so further information about the Web page quality should be included to achieve a better crawling policy. Politeness policy [ edit ] Crawlers can retrieve data much quicker and in greater depth than human searchers, so they can have a crippling impact on the performance of a site. If a single crawler is performing multiple requests per second and/or downloading large files, a server can have a hard time keeping up with requests from multiple crawlers. As noted by Koster, the use of Web crawlers is useful for a number of tasks, but comes with a price for the general community. [ 34 ] The costs of using Web crawlers include: network resources, as crawlers require considerable bandwidth and operate with a high degree of parallelism during a long period of time; server overload, especially if the frequency of accesses to a given server is too high; poorly written crawlers, which can crash servers or routers, or which download pages they cannot handle; and personal crawlers that, if deployed by too many users, can disrupt networks and Web servers. A partial solution to these problems is the robots exclusion protocol , also known as the robots.txt protocol that is a standard for administrators to indicate which parts of their Web servers should not be accessed by crawlers. [ 35 ] This standard does not include a suggestion for the interval of visits to the same server, even though this interval is the most effective way of avoiding server overload. Recently commercial search engines like Google , Ask Jeeves , MSN and Yahoo! Search are able to use an extra \"Crawl-delay:\" parameter in the robots.txt file to indicate the number of seconds to delay between requests. The first proposed interval between successive pageloads was 60 seconds. [ 36 ] However, if pages were downloaded at this rate from a website with more than 100,000 pages over a perfect connection with zero latency and infinite bandwidth, it would take more than 2 months to download only that entire Web site; also, only a fraction of the resources from that Web server would be used. Cho uses 10 seconds as an interval for accesses, [ 31 ] and the WIRE crawler uses 15 seconds as the default. [ 37 ] The MercatorWeb crawler follows an adaptive politeness policy: if it took t seconds to download a document from a given server, the crawler waits for 10 t seconds before downloading the next page. [ 38 ] Dill et al. use 1 second. [ 39 ] For those using Web crawlers for research purposes, a more detailed cost-benefit analysis is needed and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deciding where to crawl and how fast to crawl. [ 40 ] Anecdotal evidence from access logs shows that access intervals from known crawlers vary between 20 seconds and 3–4 minutes. It is worth noticing that even when being very polite, and taking all the safeguards to avoid overloading Web servers, some complaints from Web server administrators are received. Sergey Brin and Larry Page noted in 1998, \"... running a crawler which connects to more than half a million servers ... generates a fair amount of e-mail and phone calls. Because of the vast number of people coming on line, there are always those who do not know what a crawler is, because this is the first one they have seen.\" [ 41 ] Parallelization policy [ edit ] Main article: Distributed web crawling A parallel crawler is a crawler that runs multiple processes in parallel. The goal is to maximize the download rate while minimizing the overhead from parallelization and to avoid repeated downloads of the same page. To avoid downloading the same page more than once, the crawling system requires a policy for assigning the new URLs discovered during the crawling process, as the same URL can be found by two different crawling processes. Architectures [ edit ] High-level architecture of a standard Web crawler A crawler must not only have a good crawling strategy, as noted in the previous sections, but it should also have a highly optimized architecture. Shkapenyuk and Suel noted that: [ 42 ] While it is fairly easy to build a slow crawler that downloads a few pages per second for a short period of time, building a high-performance system that can download hundreds of millions of pages over several weeks presents a number of challenges in system design, I/O and network efficiency, and robustness and manageability. Web crawlers are a central part of search engines, and details on their algorithms and architecture are kept as business secrets. When crawler designs are published, there is often an important lack of detail that prevents others from reproducing the work. There are also emerging concerns about \" search engine spamming \", which prevent major search engines from publishing their ranking algorithms. Security [ edit ] While most of the website owners are keen to have their pages indexed as broadly as possible to have strong presence in search engines , web crawling can also have unintended consequences and lead to a compromise or data breach if a search engine indexes resources that should not be publicly available, or pages revealing potentially vulnerable versions of software. Main article: Google hacking Apart from standard web application security recommendations website owners can reduce their exposure to opportunistic hacking by only allowing search engines to index the public parts of their websites (with robots.txt ) and explicitly blocking them from indexing transactional parts (login pages, private pages, etc.). Crawler identification [ edit ] Web crawlers typically identify themselves to a Web server by using the User-agent field of an HTTP request. Web site administrators typically examine their Web servers ' log and use the user agent field to determine which crawlers have visited the web server and how often. The user agent field may include a URL where the Web site administrator may find out more information about the crawler. Examining Web server log is tedious task, and therefore some administrators use tools to identify, track and verify Web crawlers. Spambots and other malicious Web crawlers are unlikely to place identifying information in the user agent field, or they may mask their identity as a browser or other well-known crawler. Web site administrators prefer Web crawlers to identify themselves so that they can contact the owner if needed. In some cases, crawlers may be accidentally trapped in a crawler trap or they may be overloading a Web server with requests, and the owner needs to stop the crawler. Identification is also useful for administrators that are interested in knowing when they may expect their Web pages to be indexed by a particular search engine . Crawling the deep web [ edit ] A vast amount of web pages lie in the deep or invisible web . [ 43 ] These pages are typically only accessible by submitting queries to a database, and regular crawlers are unable to find these pages if there are no links that point to them. Google's Sitemaps protocol and mod oai [ 44 ] are intended to allow discovery of these deep-Web resources. Deep web crawling also multiplies the number of web links to be crawled. Some crawlers only take some of the URLs in <a href=\"URL\"> form. In some cases, such as the Googlebot , Web crawling is done on all text contained inside the hypertext content, tags, or text. Strategic approaches may be taken to target deep Web content. With a technique called screen scraping , specialized software may be customized to automatically and repeatedly query a given Web form with the intention of aggregating the resulting data. Such software can be used to span multiple Web forms across multiple Websites. Data extracted from the results of one Web form submission can be taken and applied as input to another Web form thus establishing continuity across the Deep Web in a way not possible with traditional web crawlers. [ 45 ] Pages built on AJAX are among those causing problems to web crawlers. Google has proposed a format of AJAX calls that their bot can recognize and index. [ 46 ] Visual vs programmatic crawlers [ edit ] There are a number of \"visual web scraper/crawler\" products available on the web which will crawl pages and structure data into columns and rows based on the users requirements. One of the main difference between a classic and a visual crawler is the level of programming ability required to set up a crawler. The latest generation of \"visual scrapers\" remove the majority of the programming skill needed to be able to program and start a crawl to scrape web data. The visual scraping/crawling method relies on the user \"teaching\" a piece of crawler technology, which then follows patterns in semi-structured data sources. The dominant method for teaching a visual crawler is by highlighting data in a browser and training columns and rows. While the technology is not new, for example it was the basis of Needlebase which has been bought by Google (as part of a larger acquisition of ITA Labs [ 47 ] ), there is continued growth and investment in this area by investors and end-users. [ citation needed ] List of web crawlers [ edit ] Further information: List of search engine software The following is a list of published crawler architectures for general-purpose crawlers (excluding focused web crawlers), with a brief description that includes the names given to the different components and outstanding features: Historical web crawlers [ edit ] WolfBot was a massively multi threaded crawler built in 2001 by Mani Singh a Civil Engineering graduate from the University of California at Davis. World Wide Web Worm was a crawler used to build a simple index of document titles and URLs. The index could be searched by using the grep Unix command. Yahoo! Slurp was the name of the Yahoo! Search crawler until Yahoo! contracted with Microsoft to use Bingbot instead. In-house web crawlers [ edit ] Applebot is Apple 's web crawler. It supports Siri and other products. [ 48 ] Bingbot is the name of Microsoft's Bing webcrawler. It replaced Msnbot . Baiduspider is Baidu 's web crawler. DuckDuckBot is DuckDuckGo 's web crawler. Googlebot is described in some detail, but the reference is only about an early version of its architecture, which was written in C++ and Python . The crawler was integrated with the indexing process, because text parsing was done for full-text indexing and also for URL extraction. There is a URL server that sends lists of URLs to be fetched by several crawling processes. During parsing, the URLs found were passed to a URL server that checked if the URL have been previously seen. If not, the URL was added to the queue of the URL server. WebCrawler was used to build the first publicly available full-text index of a subset of the Web. It was based on lib-WWW to download pages, and another program to parse and order URLs for breadth-first exploration of the Web graph. It also included a real-time crawler that followed links based on the similarity of the anchor text with the provided query. WebFountain is a distributed, modular crawler similar to Mercator but written in C++. Xenon is a web crawler used by government tax authorities to detect fraud.

This does not affect your ability to read Wikipedia pages. The account 34.68.0.0/16 has been blocked by ‪Blablubbs‬ for the following reason(s): Why you are seeing this message: Your current IP address is blocked from editing Wikipedia because it appears to belong to a VPN or proxy service . These types of services are commonly used for abusive editing and circumventing Wikipedia policies, so Wikipedia blocks them as a preventive measure — even if you personally haven't done anything wrong. How to fix it: Turn off VPNs, proxies, or tools like iCloud Private Relay (for Apple users) or Microsoft Edge Secure Network . This is the most frequent reason users encounter this block. Try a different connection. Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, or use a home network instead of a public or work one. Whitelist Wikipedia. You may be able to whitelist Wikipedia from your VPN so that connections to Wikipedia aren't through a VPN service. Instructions for whitelisting Wikipedia on iCloud Private Relay can be found here . Still blocked? If you believe you are not running an anonymizing proxy or Tor, you should consider checking the configuration to make sure it is accurate. Sometimes the configuration for your network is changed without your knowledge, sometimes by malware. In truly exceptional circumstances, you may request IP block exemption . Approval is limited and based on specific criteria, and you should only request it if you have no other way to edit Wikipedia. Note : These blocks are about the type of internet connection, not your actions. We appreciate good-faith contributors and want to help you get editing again. How to appeal if you are confident that your connection does not use a colocation provider's IP address: If you are confident that you are not using a web host, you may appeal this block by adding the following text on your talk page : {{ unblock |reason=Caught by a colocation web host block but this host or IP is not a web host. My IP address is _______. Place any further information here. ~~~~}} . You must fill in the blank with your IP address for this block to be investigated. Your IP address can be determined here . Alternatively, if you wish to keep your IP address private you can use the unblock ticket request system . There are several reasons you might be editing using the IP address of a web host or colocation provider (such as if you are using VPN software or a business network); please use this method of appeal only if you think your IP address is in fact not a web host or colocation provider. Information for administrators: Administrators: The IP block exemption user right should only be applied to allow users to edit using web host in exceptional circumstances, and requests should usually be directed to the functionaries team via email. If you intend to give the IPBE user right, a CheckUser needs to take a look at the account. This can be requested most easily at SPI Quick Checkuser Requests . Unblocking an IP or IP range with this template is highly discouraged without at least contacting the blocking administrator. This block will expire on 17:40, 25 September 2027. Even when blocked, you will usually still be able to edit your user talk page , as well as email administrators and other editors. For information on how to proceed, please read the FAQ for blocked users and the guideline on block appeals . The guide to appealing blocks may also be helpful.

The [[algorithm]] may be applied to any collection of entities with [[reciprocal link|reciprocal]] quotations and references. The numerical weight that it assigns to any given element ''E'' is referred to as the ''PageRank of E'' and denoted by <math>PR(E).</math> A PageRank results from a mathematical algorithm based on the [[Webgraph]], created by all World Wide Web pages as nodes and [[hyperlink]]s as edges, taking into consideration authority hubs such as [[cnn.com]] or [[mayoclinic.org]]. The rank value indicates an importance of a particular page. A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support. The PageRank of a page is defined [[recursion|recursively]] and depends on the number and PageRank metric of all pages that link to it (\"[[incoming link]]s\"). A page that is linked to by many pages with high PageRank receives a high rank itself. Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper.<ref name=\"originalpaper\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brin | first1 = S. | author-link1 = Sergey Brin | last2 = Page | first2 = L. | author-link2 = Larry Page | doi = 10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00110-X | title = The anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual Web search engine | journal = Computer Networks and ISDN Systems | volume = 30 | issue = 1–7 | pages = 107–117 | year = 1998 | url = http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf | issn = 0169-7552 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150927004511/http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf | archive-date = 2015-09-27 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.115.5930 | s2cid = 7587743 }}</ref> In practice, the PageRank concept may be vulnerable to manipulation.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] It is a multidisciplinary science that combines physiology , anatomy , molecular biology , developmental biology , cytology , psychology , physics , computer science , chemistry , medicine , statistics , and mathematical modeling to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons , glia and neural circuits . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The understanding of the biological basis of learning , memory , behavior , perception , and consciousness has been described by Eric Kandel as the \"epic challenge\" of the biological sciences . [ 9 ] The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system at different scales. The techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory , motor and cognitive tasks in the brain. History [ edit ] Main article: History of neuroscience Illustration from Gray's Anatomy (1918) of a lateral view of the human brain , featuring the hippocampus among other neuroanatomical features The earliest study of the nervous system dates to ancient Egypt . Trepanation , the surgical practice of either drilling or scraping a hole into the skull for the purpose of curing head injuries or mental disorders , or relieving cranial pressure, was first recorded during the Neolithic period. Manuscripts dating to 1700 BC indicate that the Egyptians had some knowledge about symptoms of brain damage . [ 10 ] Early views on the function of the brain regarded it to be a \"cranial stuffing\" of sorts. In Egypt , from the late Middle Kingdom onwards, the brain was regularly removed in preparation for mummification . It was believed at the time that the heart was the seat of intelligence. According to Herodotus , the first step of mummification was to \"take a crooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the nostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared of the rest by rinsing with drugs.\" [ 11 ] The view that the heart was the source of consciousness was not challenged until the time of the Greek physician Hippocrates . He believed that the brain was not only involved with sensation—since most specialized organs (e.g., eyes, ears, tongue) are located in the head near the brain—but was also the seat of intelligence. [ 12 ] Plato also speculated that the brain was the seat of the rational part of the soul. [ 13 ] Aristotle , however, believed the heart was the center of intelligence and that the brain regulated the amount of heat from the heart. [ 14 ] This view was generally accepted until the Roman physician Galen , a follower of Hippocrates and physician to Roman gladiators , observed that his patients lost their mental faculties when they had sustained damage to their brains. [ 15 ] Abulcasis , Averroes , Avicenna , Avenzoar , and Maimonides , active in the Medieval Muslim world, described a number of medical problems related to the brain. In Renaissance Europe , Vesalius (1514–1564), René Descartes (1596–1650), Thomas Willis (1621–1675) and Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680) also made several contributions to neuroscience. The Golgi stain first allowed for the visualization of individual neurons. Luigi Galvani 's pioneering work in the late 1700s set the stage for studying the electrical excitability of muscles and neurons. In 1843 Emil du Bois-Reymond demonstrated the electrical nature of the nerve signal, [ 16 ] whose speed Hermann von Helmholtz proceeded to measure, [ 17 ] and in 1875 Richard Caton found electrical phenomena in the cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys. [ 18 ] Adolf Beck published in 1890 similar observations of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs. [ 19 ] Studies of the brain became more sophisticated after the invention of the microscope and the development of a staining procedure by Camillo Golgi during the late 1890s. The procedure used a silver chromate salt to reveal the intricate structures of individual neurons . His technique was used by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and led to the formation of the neuron doctrine , the hypothesis that the functional unit of the brain is the neuron. [ 20 ] Golgi and Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their extensive observations, descriptions, and categorizations of neurons throughout the brain. In parallel with this research, in 1815 Jean Pierre Flourens induced localized lesions of the brain in living animals to observe their effects on motricity, sensibility and behavior. Work with brain-damaged patients by Marc Dax in 1836 and Paul Broca in 1865 suggested that certain regions of the brain were responsible for certain functions. At the time, these findings were seen as a confirmation of Franz Joseph Gall 's theory that language was localized and that certain psychological functions were localized in specific areas of the cerebral cortex . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The localization of function hypothesis was supported by observations of epileptic patients conducted by John Hughlings Jackson , who correctly inferred the organization of the motor cortex by watching the progression of seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke further developed the theory of the specialization of specific brain structures in language comprehension and production. Modern research through neuroimaging techniques, still uses the Brodmann cerebral cytoarchitectonic map (referring to the study of cell structure ) anatomical definitions from this era in continuing to show that distinct areas of the cortex are activated in the execution of specific tasks. [ 23 ] During the 20th century, neuroscience began to be recognized as a distinct academic discipline in its own right, rather than as studies of the nervous system within other disciplines. Eric Kandel and collaborators have cited David Rioch , Francis O. Schmitt , and Stephen Kuffler as having played critical roles in establishing the field. [ 24 ] Rioch originated the integration of basic anatomical and physiological research with clinical psychiatry at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research , starting in the 1950s. During the same period, Schmitt established a neuroscience research program within the Biology Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , bringing together biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The first freestanding neuroscience department (then called Psychobiology) was founded in 1964 at the University of California, Irvine by James L. McGaugh . [ 25 ] This was followed by the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School , which was founded in 1966 by Stephen Kuffler. [ 26 ] 3-D sensory and motor homunculus models at the Natural History Museum, London In the process of treating epilepsy , Wilder Penfield produced maps of the location of various functions (motor, sensory, memory, vision) in the brain. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] He summarized his findings in a 1950 book called The Cerebral Cortex of Man . [ 29 ] Wilder Penfield and his co-investigators Edwin Boldrey and Theodore Rasmussen are considered to be the originators of the cortical homunculus . [ 30 ] The understanding of neurons and of nervous system function became increasingly precise and molecular during the 20th century. For example, in 1952, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley presented a mathematical model for the transmission of electrical signals in neurons of the giant axon of a squid, which they called \" action potentials \", and how they are initiated and propagated, known as the Hodgkin–Huxley model . In 1961–1962, Richard FitzHugh and J. Nagumo simplified Hodgkin–Huxley, in what is called the FitzHugh–Nagumo model . In 1962, Bernard Katz modeled neurotransmission across the space between neurons known as synapses . Beginning in 1966, Eric Kandel and collaborators examined biochemical changes in neurons associated with learning and memory storage in Aplysia . In 1981 Catherine Morris and Harold Lecar combined these models in the Morris–Lecar model . Such increasingly quantitative work gave rise to numerous biological neuron models and models of neural computation . As a result of the increasing interest about the nervous system, several prominent neuroscience organizations have been formed to provide a forum to all neuroscientists during the 20th century. For example, the International Brain Research Organization was founded in 1961, [ 31 ] the International Society for Neurochemistry in 1963, [ 32 ] the European Brain and Behaviour Society in 1968, [ 33 ] and the Society for Neuroscience in 1969. [ 34 ] Recently, the application of neuroscience research results has also given rise to applied disciplines as neuroeconomics , [ 35 ] neuroeducation , [ 36 ] neuroethics , [ 37 ] and neurolaw . [ 38 ] Over time, brain research has gone through philosophical, experimental, and theoretical phases, with work on neural implants and brain simulation predicted to be important in the future. [ 39 ] Modern neuroscience [ edit ] Main article: Outline of neuroscience Human nervous system The scientific study of the nervous system increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, principally due to advances in molecular biology , electrophysiology , and computational neuroscience . This has allowed neuroscientists to study the nervous system in all its aspects: how it is structured, how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be changed. For example, it has become possible to understand, in much detail, the complex processes occurring within a single neuron . Neurons are cells specialized for communication. They are able to communicate with neurons and other cell types through specialized junctions called synapses , at which electrical or electrochemical signals can be transmitted from one cell to another. Many neurons extrude a long thin filament of axoplasm called an axon , which may extend to distant parts of the body and are capable of rapidly carrying electrical signals, influencing the activity of other neurons, muscles, or glands at their termination points. A nervous system emerges from the assemblage of neurons that are connected to each other in neural circuits , and networks . The vertebrate nervous system can be split into two parts: the central nervous system (defined as the brain and spinal cord ), and the peripheral nervous system . In many species—including all vertebrates—the nervous system is the most complex organ system in the body, with most of the complexity residing in the brain. The human brain alone contains around one hundred billion neurons and one hundred trillion synapses; it consists of thousands of distinguishable substructures, connected to each other in synaptic networks whose intricacies have only begun to be unraveled. At least one out of three of the approximately 20,000 genes belonging to the human genome is expressed mainly in the brain. [ 40 ] Due to the high degree of plasticity of the human brain, the structure of its synapses and their resulting functions change throughout life. [ 41 ] Making sense of the nervous system's dynamic complexity is a formidable research challenge. Ultimately, neuroscientists would like to understand every aspect of the nervous system, including how it works, how it develops, how it malfunctions, and how it can be altered or repaired. Analysis of the nervous system is therefore performed at multiple levels, ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems and cognitive levels. The specific topics that form the main focus of research change over time, driven by an ever-expanding base of knowledge and the availability of increasingly sophisticated technical methods. Improvements in technology have been the primary drivers of progress. Developments in electron microscopy , computer science , electronics , functional neuroimaging , and genetics and genomics have all been major drivers of progress. Advances in the classification of brain cells have been enabled by electrophysiological recording, single-cell genetic sequencing , and high-quality microscopy, which have combined into a single method pipeline called patch-sequencing in which all three methods are simultaneously applied using miniature tools. [ 42 ] The efficiency of this method and the large amounts of data that is generated has allowed researchers to make some general conclusions about cell types; for example that the human and mouse brain have different versions of fundamentally the same cell types. [ 43 ] Molecular and cellular neuroscience [ edit ] Main articles: Molecular neuroscience and Cellular neuroscience Photograph of a stained neuron in a chicken embryo Basic questions addressed in molecular neuroscience include the mechanisms by which neurons express and respond to molecular signals and how axons form complex connectivity patterns. At this level, tools from molecular biology and genetics are used to understand how neurons develop and how genetic changes affect biological functions. [ 44 ] The morphology , molecular identity, and physiological characteristics of neurons and how they relate to different types of behavior are also of considerable interest. [ 45 ] Questions addressed in cellular neuroscience include the mechanisms of how neurons process signals physiologically and electrochemically. These questions include how signals are processed by neurites and somas and how neurotransmitters and electrical signals are used to process information in a neuron. Neurites are thin extensions from a neuronal cell body , consisting of dendrites (specialized to receive synaptic inputs from other neurons) and axons (specialized to conduct nerve impulses called action potentials ). Somas are the cell bodies of the neurons and contain the nucleus. [ 46 ] Another major area of cellular neuroscience is the investigation of the development of the nervous system . [ 47 ] Questions include the patterning and regionalization of the nervous system, axonal and dendritic development, trophic interactions , synapse formation and the implication of fractones in neural stem cells , [ 48 ] [ 49 ] differentiation of neurons and glia ( neurogenesis and gliogenesis ), and neuronal migration . [ 50 ] Computational neurogenetic modeling is concerned with the development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes, on the cellular level (Computational Neurogenetic Modeling (CNGM) can also be used to model neural systems). [ 51 ] Neural circuits and systems [ edit ] Main articles: Neural circuit and Systems neuroscience Proposed organization of motor-semantic neural circuits for action language comprehension. Adapted from Shebani et al. (2013). Systems neuroscience research centers on the structural and functional architecture of the developing human brain, and the functions of large-scale brain networks , or functionally-connected systems within the brain. Alongside brain development, systems neuroscience also focuses on how the structure and function of the brain enables or restricts the processing of sensory information, using learned mental models of the world, to motivate behavior. Questions in systems neuroscience include how neural circuits are formed and used anatomically and physiologically to produce functions such as reflexes , multisensory integration , motor coordination , circadian rhythms , emotional responses , learning , and memory . [ 52 ] In other words, this area of research studies how connections are made and morphed in the brain, and the effect it has on human sensation, movement, attention, inhibitory control, decision-making, reasoning, memory formation, reward, and emotion regulation. [ 53 ] Specific areas of interest for the field include observations of how the structure of neural circuits effect skill acquisition, how specialized regions of the brain develop and change ( neuroplasticity ), and the development of brain atlases, or wiring diagrams of individual developing brains. [ 54 ] The related fields of neuroethology and neuropsychology address the question of how neural substrates underlie specific animal and human behaviors. [ 55 ] Neuroendocrinology and psychoneuroimmunology examine interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine and immune systems, respectively. [ 56 ] Despite many advancements, the way that networks of neurons perform complex cognitive processes and behaviors is still poorly understood. [ 57 ] Cognitive and behavioral neuroscience [ edit ] Main articles: Behavioral neuroscience and Cognitive neuroscience Cognitive neuroscience addresses the questions of how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry . The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI , PET , SPECT ), EEG , MEG , electrophysiology , optogenetics and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows that there is an interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology. [ 58 ] Moreover, the neuroscientific identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process. [ 59 ] Neuroscience is also allied with the social and behavioral sciences , as well as with nascent interdisciplinary fields. Examples of such alliances include neuroeconomics , decision theory , social neuroscience , and neuromarketing to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment. A study into consumer responses for example uses EEG to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency . [ 60 ] Computational neuroscience [ edit ] Main article: Computational neuroscience Questions in computational neuroscience can span a wide range of levels of traditional analysis, such as development , structure , and cognitive functions of the brain. Research in this field utilizes mathematical models , theoretical analysis, and computer simulation to describe and verify biologically plausible neurons and nervous systems. For example, biological neuron models are mathematical descriptions of spiking neurons which can be used to describe both the behavior of single neurons as well as the dynamics of neural networks . Computational neuroscience is often referred to as theoretical neuroscience. Neuroscience and medicine [ edit ] Clinical neuroscience [ edit ] Main article: Neurotherapy Further information: Clinical neuroscience Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, anesthesiology and pain medicine , neuropathology, neuroradiology , ophthalmology , otolaryngology , clinical neurophysiology , addiction medicine , and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the diseases of the nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. [ 61 ] Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke , and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on affective , behavioral, cognitive , and perceptual disorders. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. Neuropathology focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. [ 62 ] Neuroscience underlies the development of various neurotherapy methods to treat diseases of the nervous system. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Translational research [ edit ] Further information: Translational research and Translational neuroscience An MRI of a human head showing benign familial macrocephaly (head circumference > 60 cm) Recently, the boundaries between various specialties have blurred, as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience. For example, brain imaging enables objective biological insight into mental illnesses, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and improved monitoring of patient progress over time. [ 66 ] Integrative neuroscience describes the effort to combine models and information from multiple levels of research to develop a coherent model of the nervous system. For example, brain imaging coupled with physiological numerical models and theories of fundamental mechanisms may shed light on psychiatric disorders. [ 67 ] Another important area of translational research is brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), or machines that are able to communicate and influence the brain. They are currently being researched for their potential to repair neural systems and restore certain cognitive functions. [ 68 ] However, some ethical considerations have to be dealt with before they are accepted. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Major branches [ edit ] Modern neuroscience education and research activities can be very roughly categorized into the following major branches, based on the subject and scale of the system in examination as well as distinct experimental or curricular approaches. Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several distinct subfields. List of the major branches of neuroscience Branch Description Affective neuroscience Affective neuroscience is the study of the neural mechanisms involved in emotion, typically through experimentation on animal models.

[ 89 ] [ 74 ] Neuro-ophthalmology Neuro-ophthalmology is an academically oriented subspecialty that merges the fields of neurology and ophthalmology, often dealing with complex systemic diseases that have manifestations in the visual system. Neurophysics Neurophysics is the branch of biophysics dealing with the development and use of physical methods to gain information about the nervous system. [ 90 ] Neurophysiology Neurophysiology is the study of the structure and function of the nervous system, generally using physiological techniques that include measurement and stimulation with electrodes or optically with ion- or voltage-sensitive dyes or light-sensitive channels. [ 91 ] Neuropsychology Neuropsychology is a discipline that resides under the umbrellas of both psychology and neuroscience, and is involved in activities in the arenas of both basic science and applied science. In psychology, it is most closely associated with biopsychology , clinical psychology , cognitive psychology , and developmental psychology . In neuroscience, it is most closely associated with the cognitive, behavioral, social, and affective neuroscience areas. In the applied and medical domain, it is related to neurology and psychiatry. [ 92 ] Neuropsychopharmacology Neuropsychopharmacology, an interdisciplinary science related to psychopharmacology and fundamental neuroscience, is the study of the neural mechanisms that drugs act upon to influence behavior.

Since its founding in 1969 the SFN has grown steadily: as of 2010 it recorded 40,290 members from 83 countries. [ 98 ] Annual meetings, held each year in a different American city, draw attendance from researchers, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates, as well as educational institutions, funding agencies, publishers, and hundreds of businesses that supply products used in research. Other major organizations devoted to neuroscience include the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO), which holds its meetings in a country from a different part of the world each year, and the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies (FENS), which holds a meeting in a different European city every two years. FENS comprises a set of 32 national-level organizations, including the British Neuroscience Association , the German Neuroscience Society ( Neurowissenschaftliche Gesellschaft ), and the French Société des Neurosciences . [ 99 ] The first National Honor Society in Neuroscience, Nu Rho Psi , was founded in 2006. Numerous youth neuroscience societies which support undergraduates, graduates and early career researchers also exist, such as Simply Neuroscience [ 100 ] and Project Encephalon. [ 101 ] In 2013, the BRAIN Initiative was announced in the US. The International Brain Initiative [ 102 ] was created in 2017, [ 103 ] currently integrated by more than seven national-level brain research initiatives (US, Europe , Allen Institute , Japan , China , Australia, [ 104 ] Canada, [ 105 ] Korea, [ 106 ] and Israel [ 107 ] ) [ 108 ] spanning four continents. Public education and outreach [ edit ] In addition to conducting traditional research in laboratory settings, neuroscientists have also been involved in the promotion of awareness and knowledge about the nervous system among the general public and government officials. Such promotions have been done by both individual neuroscientists and large organizations. For example, individual neuroscientists have promoted neuroscience education among young students by organizing the International Brain Bee , which is an academic competition for high school or secondary school students worldwide. [ 109 ] In the United States, large organizations such as the Society for Neuroscience have promoted neuroscience education by developing a primer called Brain Facts, [ 110 ] collaborating with public school teachers to develop Neuroscience Core Concepts for K-12 teachers and students, [ 111 ] and cosponsoring a campaign with the Dana Foundation called Brain Awareness Week to increase public awareness about the progress and benefits of brain research. [ 112 ] In Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research's (CIHR) Canadian National Brain Bee is held annually at McMaster University . [ 113 ] Neuroscience educators formed a Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN) in 1992 to share best practices and provide travel awards for undergraduates presenting at Society for Neuroscience meetings. [ 114 ] Neuroscientists have also collaborated with other education experts to study and refine educational techniques to optimize learning among students, an emerging field called educational neuroscience . [ 115 ] Federal agencies in the United States, such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) [ 116 ] and National Science Foundation (NSF), [ 117 ] have also funded research that pertains to best practices in teaching and learning of neuroscience concepts. Engineering applications of neuroscience [ edit ] Neuromorphic computer chips [ edit ] Neuromorphic engineering is a branch of neuroscience that deals with creating functional physical models of neurons for the purposes of useful computation [ 118 ] [ 119 ] . The emergent computational properties of neuromorphic computers are fundamentally different from conventional computers in the sense that they are complex systems , and that the computational components are interrelated with no central processor. [ 120 ] One example of such a computer is the SpiNNaker supercomputer. [ 121 ] Sensors can also be made smart with neuromorphic technology. An example of this is the Event Camera 's BrainScaleS (brain-inspired Multiscale Computation in Neuromorphic Hybrid Systems), a hybrid analog neuromorphic supercomputer located at Heidelberg University in Germany. It was developed as part of the Human Brain Project 's neuromorphic computing platform and is the complement to the SpiNNaker supercomputer, which is based on digital technology. The architecture used in BrainScaleS mimics biological neurons and their connections on a physical level; additionally, since the components are made of silicon, these model neurons operate on average 864 times (24 hours of real time is 100 seconds in the machine simulation) that of their biological counterparts. [ 122 ] Recent advances in neuromorphic microchip technology have led a group of scientists to create an artificial neuron that can replace real neurons in diseases.

In the context of search engine optimization , keyword density can be used to determine whether a web page is relevant to a specified keyword or keyword phrase. In the late 1990s, the early days of search engines , keyword density was an important factor in page ranking within search results. However, as webmasters (website managers) discovered how to implement optimum keyword density, search engines began giving priority to other factors beyond the direct control of webmasters. [ 1 ] Today, the overuse of keywords, a practice called keyword stuffing , will cause a web page to be penalized by search engines. [ 2 ] The formula to calculate keyword density on a web page for search engine optimization purposes is ( N k r / T k n ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle (Nkr/Tkn)*100} , where Nkr is how many times a specific keyword is repeated , and Tkn is the total words in the analyzed text. The result is the keyword density value. When calculating keyword density, HTML tags and other embedded tags that do not appear in the text of the published page should be ignored. When calculating the density of a keyword phrase, the formula is ( N k r ∗ N w p / T k n ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle (Nkr*Nwp/Tkn)*100} , [ 3 ] Where Nwp is the number of words in the phrase. For example, for a 400-word page about search engine optimization where \"search engine optimization\" is used four times, the keyword phrase density is (4*3/400)*100 or 3 percent. From a mathematical viewpoint, the original concept of keyword density refers to the frequency (Nkr) of the appearance of a keyword in a dissertation. A \"keyword\" consisting of multiple terms, e.g. \"blue suede shoes,\" is an entity in itself. The frequency of the phrase \"blue suede shoes\" within a dissertation drives the keyphrase density. It is mathematically correct for a 'keyphrase' to be calculated just like the original calculation but considering the word group, \"blue suede shoes,\" as a single appearance, not three: Density = ( N kr T kn ) ∗ 100 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Density}}=\\left({\\frac {N_{\\text{kr}}}{T_{\\text{kn}}}}\\right)*100} Keywords that consist of several words artificially inflate the total word count of the dissertation. The purest mathematical representation should adjust the total word count T kn {\\displaystyle T_{\\text{kn}}} lower by removing the excess keyphrase word counts from the total: Density = ( N kr T kn − ( N kr ⋅ ( N wp − 1 ) ) ) × 100 {\\displaystyle {\\text{Density}}=\\left({\\frac {N_{\\text{kr}}}{T_{\\text{kn}}-\\left(N_{\\text{kr}}\\cdot (N_{\\text{wp}}-1)\\right)}}\\right)\\times 100} where N wp {\\displaystyle N_{\\text{wp}}} is the number of terms in the keyphrase. [ citation needed ] By 2022, search engines had begun to favor semantic SEO [ 4 ] meaning they understand synonyms, context, and content themes without requiring high keyword repetition.
